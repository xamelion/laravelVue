We show that the shape of the universe may actually be curved rather than flat, as previously thought \u2013 with a probability larger than 99 percent. In a curved universe, no matter which direction you travel in, you will end up at the starting point \u2013 just like on a sphere.

In our study, we showed that a closed universe can provide a physical explanation to this effect, because it is able to host a lot more dark matter than a flat universe. Such a universe is perfectly compatible with general relativity.<\/p>\n<h2>Major headache<\/h2>\n<p>Not all cosmologists are convinced by a closed universe though \u2013 previous studies have <a href=\"https:\/\/map.gsfc.nasa.gov\/universe\/uni_matter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">suggested the cosmos is indeed flat<\/a>. And if a spherical universe is a solution to the lensing anomaly, then we have to deal with several significant consequences. First of all, we have to revise a fundamental cornerstone of cosmology \u2013 the theory of cosmological inflation. Inflation describes the first instants after the Big Bang, predicting a period of exponential expansion for the primordial universe.<\/p>\n<p>The theory was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.space.com\/25075-cosmic-inflation-universe-expansion-big-bang-infographic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">developed over the past 40 years<\/a> to explain why distant parts of the universe look the same and have the same temperature, when they are too far apart to ever have been in contact. Inflation solves the problem because it means that far-flung regions of the universe would once have been connected. But the period of rapid expansion that hurled these regions apart is also thought to have also brought the universe to flatness with exquisite precision.<\/p>\n<p>If the universe is closed, standard inflation is in trouble. And that means we lose our standard explanation for why the universe has the structure it has.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"540\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301117\/original\/file-20191111-194650-n7utv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301117\/original\/file-20191111-194650-n7utv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301117\/original\/file-20191111-194650-n7utv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301117\/original\/file-20191111-194650-n7utv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=540&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301117\/original\/file-20191111-194650-n7utv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=678&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301117\/original\/file-20191111-194650-n7utv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=678&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301117\/original\/file-20191111-194650-n7utv6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=678&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F17%2Fcosmology-in-crisis-as-evidence-suggests-our-universe-isnt-flat-its-actually-curved%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Possible shapes of the universe: top one is curved and closed, as suggested in the new study. wikipedia\" data-title=\"Share Possible shapes of the universe: top one is curved and closed, as suggested in the new study. wikipedia on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Possible shapes of the universe: top one is curved and closed, as suggested in the new study. wikipedia on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Possible shapes of the universe: top one is curved and closed, as suggested in the new study. wikipedia<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p><\/figure><p>Once we assume that the universe is curved, the Planck data is essentially in <a href=\"https:\/\/physicstoday.scitation.org\/doi\/full\/10.1063\/PT.3.3789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">disagreement with all other datasets<\/a>. This all boils down to a real crisis for cosmology, as we say in our paper. For these reasons, cosmologists are cautious \u2013 and many of them prefer to attribute the results to a statistical fluke that will resolve when new data from future experiments are available.<\/p>\n<h2>Could we be wrong?<\/h2>\n<p>It is certainly possible that we turn out to be wrong. But there is one main reason, in our opinion, why this anomaly should not be merely discarded. In particle physics, a discovery should reach an accuracy of at least five \u201csigmas\u201d to be accepted by the community. Here we are slightly above three sigmas, so we are clearly below this acceptance level. But while the standard model of particle physics is based on known and proven physics, the standard cosmological model is based on unknown physics.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301119\/original\/file-20191111-194641-qy5wr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301119\/original\/file-20191111-194641-qy5wr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301119\/original\/file-20191111-194641-qy5wr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301119\/original\/file-20191111-194641-qy5wr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301119\/original\/file-20191111-194641-qy5wr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301119\/original\/file-20191111-194641-qy5wr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/301119\/original\/file-20191111-194641-qy5wr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=425&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F17%2Fcosmology-in-crisis-as-evidence-suggests-our-universe-isnt-flat-its-actually-curved%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Perhaps not? coldcreation, CC BY-SA\" data-title=\"Share Perhaps not? coldcreation, CC BY-SA on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Perhaps not? coldcreation, CC BY-SA on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Perhaps not? coldcreation, CC BY-SA<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p><\/figure><p>At the moment, the physical evidence for the three pillars of cosmology \u2013 dark matter, dark energy (which causes the universe to expand at an accelerated rate) and inflation \u2013 comes solely from cosmology. Their existence can explain many astrophysical observations.<\/p>\n<p>But they are not expected either in the standard model of particle physics that governs the universe on the smallest scales or in the theory of general relativity that operates on the large scales.

Science fiction has been articulating our hopes and fears about technological disruption at least since Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein (1818).<\/p>\n<p>However, as the likes of driverless cars and robot therapists emerge, some previously fictional concerns are no longer imaginative speculation. Instead, they represent real and urgent problems.<\/p>\n<h2>What kind of future do we want?<\/h2>\n<p>Last year, Australia\u2019s Chief Scientist Alan Finkel <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chiefscientist.gov.au\/2018\/07\/speech-what-kind-of-society-do-we-want-to-be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">suggested<\/a> that we in Australia should become \u201chuman custodians.\u201d This would mean being leaders in technological development, ethics, and human rights.<\/p>\n<p>Finkel isn\u2019t alone in his concern. But it won\u2019t be simple to address these issues in the development of new technology.<\/p>\n<p>Many people in government, industry,\u00a0 and universities now argue that including perspectives from the humanities and social sciences will be a key factor.<\/p>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/acola.org\/hs4-artificial-intelligence-australia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">report<\/a> from the Australian Council of Learned Academies (ACOLA) brought together experts from scientific and technical fields as well as the humanities, arts and social sciences to examine key issues arising from artificial intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>According to the chair of the ACOLA board, Hugh Bradlow, the report aims to ensure that \u201cthe well-being of society\u201d is placed \u201cat the center of any development.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Human-centred AI<\/h2>\n<p>A similar vision drives Stanford University\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/hai.stanford.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence<\/a>. The institute brings together researchers from the humanities, education, law, medicine, business,\u00a0 and STEM to study and develop \u201chuman-centered\u201d AI technologies. The idea underpinning their work is that \u201cAI should be collaborative, augmentative and enhancing to human productivity and quality of life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford similarly investigates \u201cbig-picture questions\u201d to ensure \u201ca long and flourishing future for humanity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The center is set to double in size in the next year thanks to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fhi.ox.ac.uk\/grant-announcement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\u00a313.3 million (A$25 million) contribution<\/a> from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openphilanthropy.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Open Philanthropy Project<\/a>. The founder of the institute, philosopher Nick Bostrom, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>There is a long-distance race on between humanity\u2019s technological capability, which is like a stallion galloping across the fields, and humanity\u2019s wisdom, which is more like a foal on unsteady legs.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>What to build and why<\/h2>\n<p>The IT sector is also wrestling with the ethical issues raised by rapid technological advancement. Microsoft\u2019s Brad Smith and Harry Shum wrote in their 2018 book <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/blog\/2018\/01\/17\/future-computed-artificial-intelligence-role-society\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Future Computed<\/a> that one of their \u201cmost important conclusions\u201d was that the humanities and social sciences have a crucial role to play in confronting the challenges raised by AI:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Languages, art, history, economics, ethics, philosophy, psychology and human development courses can teach critical, philosophical and ethics-based skills that will be instrumental in the development and management of AI solutions.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hiring practices in tech companies are already shifting. In a TED talk on \u201cWhy tech needs the humanities,\u201d Eric Berridge \u2013 chief executive of the IBM-owned tech consulting firm Bluewolf \u2013 explains why his company increasingly hires humanities graduates.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While the sciences teach us how to build things, it\u2019s the humanities that teach us what to build and why to build them.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Only 100 of Bluewolf\u2019s 1,000 employees have degrees in computer science and engineering. Even the Chief Technology Officer is an English major. In the following video,\u00a0<span class=\"caption\">Tech CEO Eric Berridge explains why his company hires humanities graduates.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Education for a brighter future<\/h2>\n<p>Similarly, Matt Reaney, the chief executive and founder of Big Cloud \u2013 a recruitment company that specializes in data science, machine learning,\u00a0 and AI employment \u2013 has <a href=\"https:\/\/bigcloud.io\/why-studying-humanities-and-arts-is-key-to-developing-artificial-intelligence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">argued<\/a> that technology needs more people with humanities training.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[The humanities] give context to the world we operate in day to day. Critical thinking skills, deeper understanding of the world around us, philosophy, ethics, communication, and creativity offer different approaches to problems posed by technology.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Reaney proposes a \u201cmore blended approach\u201d to higher education, offering degrees that combine the arts and STEM.<\/p>\n<p>Another advocate of the interdisciplinary approach is Joseph Aoun, President of Northeastern University in Boston. He has <a href=\"http:\/\/robot-proof.com\/#press\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">argued<\/a> that in the age of AI, higher education should be focusing on what he calls \u201chumanics,\u201d equipping graduates with three key literacies: technological literacy, data literacy, and human literacy.<\/p>\n<p>The time has come to answer the call for humanities graduates capable of crossing over into the world of technology so that our human future can be as bright as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Without training in ethics, human rights and social justice, the people who develop the technologies that will shape our future could make poor decisions. And that future might turn out to be one of the calamities we have already seen on screen.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

The headphones can be fast charged over USB (the company claims two hours of play time in just 15 minutes), and they\u2019re fairly reasonably priced at $164 (early bird buyers can order them for $99 on Indiegogo).<\/p>\n<p>The solar tech comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/exeger.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a Swedish firm called Exeger<\/a>, which claims to have developed a light harvesting material that can be shaped to fit just about anything \u2014 including the headband of a pair of headphones. The company has been at this for some time now. It remains to be seen if it can bring this to market, as there have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Headset-Headphones-Exod-Helios-Solar-black\/dp\/B013KCJYT2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">other attempts at<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/home-theater\/sola-solar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">solar-charging headphones<\/a> that didn\u2019t quite materialize or failed to make a splash.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being a major manufacturer, JBL is crowdfunding the Reflect Eternal on Indiegogo. It\u2019s likely taking this approach in order to gauge customers\u2019 interest before going all-in on this product, and also to hear from them during the development process. We\u2019ve written to JBL to ask, and will update this post when we hear back.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1262748 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"JBL says its solar-powered headphones will be available in two colorways\" width=\"737\" height=\"359\" sizes=\"(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/JBL-says-its-solar-powered-headphones-will-be-available-in-two-colorways.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/JBL-says-its-solar-powered-headphones-will-be-available-in-two-colorways.jpg 737w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/JBL-says-its-solar-powered-headphones-will-be-available-in-two-colorways-280x136.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/JBL-says-its-solar-powered-headphones-will-be-available-in-two-colorways-540x263.jpg 540w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/JBL-says-its-solar-powered-headphones-will-be-available-in-two-colorways-270x132.jpg 270w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/JBL-says-its-solar-powered-headphones-will-be-available-in-two-colorways-736x359.jpg 736w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fplugged%2F2019%2F12%2F17%2Fjbl-is-crowdfunding-solar-powered-headphones-to-kill-battery-anxiety%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: JBL says its solar-powered headphones will be available in two colorways\" data-title=\"Share JBL says its solar-powered headphones will be available in two colorways on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share JBL says its solar-powered headphones will be available in two colorways on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>JBL says its solar-powered headphones will be available in two colorways<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The Reflect Eternal is set to ship next October, and is available to customers in the US and Germany only.

        "content": "<p>This time last year, Twitch was top of the molehill when it came to game streaming. Now several of its major stars are leaving for apparently greener pastures \u2014 namely, Mixer, YouTube, and Facebook (of all things). So what brought this on?<\/p>\n<p>The deepest of these cuts, by far, was Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins. The most popular of Twitch\u2019s stars, Ninja quickly rose to prominence thanks mostly to\u00a0<em>Fortnite<\/em>. His celebrity is such that he can appear on a Super Bowl and even my non-gaming family members recognize him. So when he <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/08\/01\/ninja-leaves-twitch-for-mixer\/\">announced in August<\/a> he\u2019d be streaming exclusively on Mixer, Microsoft\u2019s streaming site that used to be called Beam, his community was shaken.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>But he wasn\u2019t the only one.\u00a0<span>Michael \u201cShroud\u201d Grzesiek became the second major streamer to join Mixer in October. He said in a statement: \u201cStreaming is my passion and I owe my success to my fans who have helped me get to where I am now. Mixer provides the flexibility to center my attention around them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Same shroud.

Almost universally, the streamers claimed their primary motivation was to spend more time interacting with their fans and communities.<\/p>\n<p>To be fair, Twitch is big enough now that no one streamer is a tentpole. While it was no doubt a disappointment to see these big streamers so publicly move to the competition, it doesn\u2019t seem to have made that big of a dent in Twitch\u2019s viewership. In fact, Twitch appears to be participating in this battle for exclusives. Last week, it signed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/12\/10\/21004943\/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">exclusive deals<\/a> with\u00a0<span>Benjamin \u201cDrLupo\u201d Lupo, Timothy \u201cTimTheTatman\u201d Betar, and Saqib \u201cLirik\u201d Zahid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Ninja\u2019s wife and manager, Jessica Blevins, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jessica-blevins-ninja-wife-manager-on-leaving-twitch-for-mixer-2019-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">told Business Insider<\/a> that the move wasn\u2019t motivated entirely by money. She and Ninja were allegedly chafing under a restrictive contract and were sick of Twitch for not returning their calls:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span>Everything we were asking, it never came back reflecting our wishes\u2026 it was really upsetting for us to go months and months and keep reiterating that we love you guys, we\u2019ve been here for a long time, but the things that are in the contract right now just don\u2019t make sense.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So how\u2019s it working out for them? Well, some data suggests the transition hasn\u2019t been seamless. A report from Streammetrics shows that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vg247.com\/2019\/12\/16\/shroud-losing-us-viewers-moving-twitch-to-mixer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Shroud lost two-thirds<\/a> of his American audience. Ninja boasts an audience on Mixer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/ninja-brought-more-streamers-to-mixer-not-more-viewers-2019-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">only a fraction<\/a> the size of that on Twitch. That said, both streamers have said that the chance to focus on a smaller audience was worth anything that might have been lost in transit. Shroud said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dexerto.com\/entertainment\/shroud-reveals-favorite-part-leaving-twitch-mixer-1230919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">during a streamed conversation<\/a> with DrLupo\u00a0that he feels less pressured on Mixer: \u201c<span>My favorite part about being here is that I can play whatever the fuck I want, and not have to feel so\u00a0pressured to play the game that everyone wants me to play.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Overall, this reminds me of a smaller-scaled version of the battle for exclusives between the likes of Netflix, Disney, HBO and the rest. Twitch, Mixer, and YouTube have come to the inescapable conclusion that the content creator matters as much as the content, and they\u2019re locking down as many of the big ones as they can.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>When I first heard about <a href=\"https:\/\/outerworlds.obsidian.net\/en\/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><\/a> I was overjoyed. Developer Obsidian Entertainment is among the most accomplished, reputable, and talented companies in the industry. Every game it touches \u2013 from <i>Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords <\/i><span>to everybody\u2019s favorite <\/span><i>Fallout <\/i><span>title, <\/span><i>Fallout New Vegas<\/i> \u2013 is an instant masterpiece.<\/p>\n<p><span>But then I heard Microsoft had acquired Obsidian Entertainment and would be debuting <\/span><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> on <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/11\/15\/xbox-game-pass-50-new-games-yakuza-final-fantasy\/\">Xbox Game Pass<\/a> like all of its in-house titles. This seemed too good to be true because it meant you could effectively play the game for free (with a trial) or for $9.99 with a subscription that includes dozens of AAA games like <\/span><i>Gears 5<\/i><span>, <\/span><i>State of Decay 2<\/i><span>, and <\/span><i>Crackdown 3. <\/i><\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p><span>My suspicion, at the time, was that the game I had dared to dream would be some kind of spiritual successor to <\/span><i>Fallout New Vegas<\/i> would end up getting distilled into a hollow version of an Obsidian Entertainment game due to Microsoft\u2019s need for quick, flashy content. After all, the developer just had to please gamers in the past. Now it\u2019s part of the Sony vs Microsoft console war that\u2019s about to enter its next generation.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1262687 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"674\" height=\"866\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/halcyon.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/halcyon.jpg 674w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/halcyon-163x210.jpg 163w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/halcyon-210x270.jpg 210w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/halcyon-105x135.jpg 105w\"><figcaption>Credit: Obsidian Entertainment<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><span>Luckily, I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. <\/span><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> isn\u2019t a concession by any means. I can\u2019t speak to the politics and business that\u2019s happened behind the scenes but, if this game is any indication of what we can expect from Obsidian Entertainment in the Microsoft era, everything\u2019s going to be just fine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> isn\u2019t the \u201cspiritual successor\u201d to <\/span><i>Fallout <\/i><span>that pundits have made it out to be. It plays a heckuva lot like the <\/span><i>Fallout<\/i> games. But that\u2019s a good thing. If you\u2019ve played <i>Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, <\/i><span>or<\/span><i> Skyrim<\/i>, you already know how to play <i>The Outer Worlds. <\/i><span>The mechanics are similar and the controller buttons (or keyboard and mouse shortcuts) work about the same. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>That\u2019s where the comparisons end. <\/span><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> eschews the dusty, dark, depressing world that <\/span><i>Fallout<\/i> relies on in exchange for several vibrant, exotic alien landscapes that act as a consummate background character. Much like <i>Borderlands 3 <\/i><span>and <\/span><i>Breath of The Wild<\/i><span>, a lot of the charm of <\/span><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> lies in trekking off the beaten-path to find little game areas that serve no purpose other than to be beautiful. I found myself walking through the game\u2018s worlds with my POV fixed on the heavens quite often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ujfolWOLD1I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span>To call <\/span><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> gorgeous is an understatement. It\u2019s not just pretty, it\u2019s also graphically smart. The game plays smooth on my Xbox One S despite having some of the best visuals I\u2019ve enjoyed in a game all year. That\u2019s not to say this game has the <\/span><i>best<\/i><span> graphics \u2013 they\u2019re good and modern, but not mind-blowing. But I\u2019ll say it does have the best <\/span><i>use of graphics<\/i>. Instead of squeezing every last drop of horsepower out of my machine, Obsidian Entertainment made clever use of color and distance. This is a game where the artists and their art shine through more than the game engine and its 3D modeling capabilities.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1262685 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/fallbrook.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/fallbrook.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/fallbrook-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/fallbrook-480x270.jpg 480w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/fallbrook-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/fallbrook-796x448.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/fallbrook-1592x896.jpg 1592w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/fallbrook-1200x675.jpg 1200w\"><figcaption>Credit: Obsidian Entertainment<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1262686 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/monarch.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/monarch.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/monarch-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/monarch-480x270.jpg 480w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/monarch-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/monarch-796x448.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/monarch-1592x896.jpg 1592w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/monarch-1200x675.jpg 1200w\"><figcaption>Credit: Obsidian Entertainment<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span>\u2018 excellent graphics are joined by some of the best audio I\u2019ve experienced in a video game. And I mean that in the overall sense. The music is compelling and perfectly unmemorable \u2013 this isn\u2019t <\/span><i>Grand Theft Auto, <\/i><span>I don\u2019t need a series of playlists. I need cinematic accompaniment. And the sounds effects are crisp, and immersive. But where the audio really makes its mark is in the voice acting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I savored every drop of dialogue in this game. The voice acting is superb in every way and the main cast deserves accolades \u2013 especially the ever-impressive, amazingly talented Ashley Burch as the coy Parvati. But it\u2019s not just the main cast that shines. The enemy callouts, and atmospheric conversations are wonderfully integrated. It never feels like you\u2019re stuck in an \u201cI used to be an adventurer like you\u201d dialogue wheel. Instead it seems like you\u2019re passing through a living set-piece full of people going about their own business. You\u2019re often given the choice to \u201ckeep listening\u201d if you interrupt characters in mid-conversation, a game mechanic I\u2019m grateful for because I almost always wanted to know what else they had to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1262688 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"589\" height=\"855\" sizes=\"(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/auntie-cleo.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/auntie-cleo.jpg 589w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/auntie-cleo-145x210.jpg 145w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/auntie-cleo-186x270.jpg 186w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/auntie-cleo-93x135.jpg 93w\"><figcaption>Credit: Obsidian Entertainment<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><span>The story is a gigantic mash-up of everything you love about science fiction with major nods to <em>Firefly<\/em><\/span>, <em>The Matrix<\/em>, <em>Futurama<\/em>, and <em>Rick and Morty<\/em>. It\u2019s hilarious and fun, and it\u2019s often sad and philosophical too. It never has all the answers, and often doesn\u2019t even ask any questions. Like much of the graphical artwork, there\u2019s bits of the story that just exist for the sake of being art \u2013 they don\u2019t move the plot along or get you where you\u2019re going.<\/p>\n<p><span>Ultimately, <\/span><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> is a game that doesn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel. It is to <\/span><i>Fallout<\/i> what \u201cStarfinder\u201d is to \u201cDungeons and Dragons.\u201d It takes a recipe you like and reinvents it in a way that feels both comfortable and new. In that way, it\u2019s the perfect swan song for the Xbox One.<\/p>\n<p><span>While Nintendo reimagined what a console was with the Switch, and Sony brought in gadgets like VR, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has dialed back the accessories and honed in on providing bedrock value. <\/span><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> isn\u2019t trying to sell you a battle royale game mode (there is only single player) or content pass. It\u2019s just a damn good game, with excellent writing, award-worthy voice acting, top-notch graphics, and some of the best western-style RPG decision-making this side of a Bioware title. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>The Outer Worlds<\/i><span> is far-and-away my favorite title of 2019. We\u2019ll spend the next year talking about new gaming systems from Sony, Microsoft, and Google, so it may be awhile before the gravity of just how good this game is sinks in. But when all the smoke clears, I believe we\u2019ll see it stand beside the likes of <\/span><i>Bioshock, Mass Effect, and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>And, yes, even\u00a0<em>New Vegas<\/em>.<\/p>",

Introduced in 1968, they were among the first children\u2019s toys that looked just like the real thing, but were meant to be played with. Kids have been racing, launching, and crashing Hot Wheels for decades. And now, thanks to the new id lineup, they\u2019re learning to code with them.<\/p>\n<p>Mattel launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/hotwheels.mattel.com\/shop\/en-us\/hw\/Hot-Wheels-id-Vehicles?icid=landing_hwid_nav_vehicles_p1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hot Wheels id<\/a> product line earlier this year. It taps the fun of playing with Hot Wheels toys as a conduit for learning STEM skills. The company today officially launched an update that adds support for Apple\u2019s Swift Playground. Kids aged eight and up use a Bluetooth-enabled \u201cPortal\u201d to scan their cars into an app on their iPad that takes them through various coding exercises.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CsLaDS0wuSE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Before we get into the experience \u2013 which has you solving code challenges to thwart the evil Draven, who\u2019s stolen a car \u2013 let\u2019s talk about what you get with your id play set. Individual vehicles cost $6.99 and each car produces a unique identifier when scanned. In order to scan vehicles you\u2019ll need the $39.99 Portal, a\u00a0Bluetooth-enabled device that let\u2019s you bring your cars from the real world into your app, or you\u2019ll need the full $180 Smart Track Kit.<\/p>\n<p>The Smart Track Kit comes with a Portal and everything you need to build fun, exciting tracks. But you don\u2019t necessarily need it. You can purchase the portal and use it with standard Hot Wheels tracks sets and even any generic track sets that work with the same sized cars. You will, however, need a Portal to use the app.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery\" tabindex=\"100\" id=\"gallery-42f313\"><div class=\"photos\"><div class=\"photos-wrap\"><div class=\"photo photo--active first\"\n                               id=\"photo_1\"\n                               data-photographer-url=\"\"\n                               data-photographer-name=\"Nicole Gray\"><a href='https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1.jpg'><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-280x210.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-360x270.jpg 360w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-180x135.jpg 180w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-796x597.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-368x276.jpg 368w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-736x552.jpg 736w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-632x474.jpg 632w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-536x402.jpg 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-id=\"1262658\" \/><\/a><\/div><div class=\"photo\"\n                               id=\"photo_2\"\n                               data-photographer-url=\"\"\n                               data-photographer-name=\"Nicole Gray\"><a href='https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408.jpg'><img width=\"659\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408.jpg 659w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408-173x210.jpg 173w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408-222x270.jpg 222w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408-111x135.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" data-id=\"1262659\" \/><\/a><\/div><\/div><\/div><ul class=\"thumbs clearfix\"><li><a href=\"#42f313_1\" class=\"selected\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-standard_widget size-standard_widget\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-280x210.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-360x270.jpg 360w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-180x135.jpg 180w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-796x597.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-368x276.jpg 368w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-736x552.jpg 736w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-632x474.jpg 632w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111701-1-536x402.jpg 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-id=\"1262658\" \/><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#42f313_2\" class=\"\"><img width=\"659\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408.jpg\" class=\"attachment-standard_widget size-standard_widget\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408.jpg 659w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408-173x210.jpg 173w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408-222x270.jpg 222w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/20191216_111408-111x135.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" data-id=\"1262659\" \/><\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"load-modules\" data-modules=\"gallery\"><\/div>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t able to check out the full Smart Track Kit, but Hot Wheels did send the Portal and several id-enabled vehicles.

\u2013 even if most of it\u2019s in my imagination. But now, with the new id series, we can watch our cars in digital format and in augmented reality. It adds a layer of cool that kids with iPads will enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to point out here that this is my first experience with Hot Wheels id. I\u2019m not typically an iPad user, but I found the app simple and fun to use. There\u2019s a bit of a learning curve when it comes to physically swiping the cars across the portal \u2013 sometimes it didn\u2019t seem to matter how I swiped, other times it called for a precise movement. The coding events are simple and work really well within the context of the story. Depending on your particular coding skill, you might find yourself a little underwhelmed with it \u2013 this is definitely geared towards kids with little or no experience in Swift Playgrounds. But the story is fun and engaging, and parents shouldn\u2019t have to worry about it being too difficult for age-appropriate kids.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery\" tabindex=\"100\"

to re-scan the vehicles in the middle of an event \u2013 presumably because the system lost them \u2013 can be annoying, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker.<\/p>\n<p>I like how Hot Wheels has chosen to package the id products. If this is your first time delving into the world of Hot Wheels, the $180 Kit might seem expensive, but it has everything you need and it\u2019s a great start for your collection. Those who aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019ll become lifelong fans and collectors should opt for the $40 Portal so they can dive into the STEM aspects. If you already have a Portal, the Apple Swift Playground update is free.<\/p>\n<p>You can purchase the full kit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07MX1XZLT\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here <\/a>and the Portal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hot-Wheels-id-Race-Portal\/dp\/B07NDXGJK3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>This post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.

The conceit is that, if the person about to post is told what they\u2019re writing is offensive, they\u2019ll have a chance to reword what they wrote.<\/p>\n<p>Considering how popular Instagram is with the younger audience, the notion that some users might stop themselves if they\u2019re properly educated on what they\u2019re saying is an attractive one. And I don\u2019t know \u2014 I haven\u2019t been an ignorant teenager in quite some time, so maybe mild chastisement from the app is enough to make one rethink word choices.<\/p>\n<p>Thing is, I\u2019m not convinced this is actually going to deter anyone who truly wants to post something offensive \u2014 it\u2019s not as though everyone who posts such things is doing so in ignorance of the fact that what they\u2019re writing could upset someone. Still, it does sort of take away deniability,\u00a0given that users can\u2019t claim they weren\u2019t warned what they wrote was naughty. Besides, the warning you get doesn\u2019t explain\u00a0<em>why\u00a0<\/em>what you\u2019re writing is problematic, just that it\u2019s been reported before.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram\u2019s made other efforts this year to combat negativity on its platform: the blog post announcing the AI is rather loftily titled \u201cOur Progress on Leading the Fight Against Online Bullying.\u201d The company rolled out <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/facebook\/2019\/10\/07\/instagram-cuts-following-tab\/\">its Restrict feature in October<\/a>, which basically allows you to block a bully or harasser from your page without them knowing. Again, it sounds good but doesn\u2019t do much to get at the root of the issue.<\/p>\n<p>According to Instagram, this feature is rolling out to select countries now, and globally in the next few months.<\/p>",

The domain name system (DNS), the protocol used to convert domain names (e.g., google.com) to IP addresses (e.g., 74.125.157.99), still remains in plain text, which can reveal much about your browsing habits.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>The<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/portswigger.net\/daily-swig\/a-guide-to-dns-over-https-how-a-new-web-protocol-aims-to-protect-your-privacy-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol<\/a>, introduced in recent years, improves the privacy of your browsing experience by adding a layer of<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2017\/03\/30\/what-is-end-to-end-encryption-cryptography\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">encryption<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>to your DNS packets.

Here\u2019s what you need to know about the privacy benefits\u2014and limits\u2014of DNS-over-HTTPS.<span id=\"more-6133\"><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>DNS privacy<\/h2>\n<p>On the internet (as well as local, offline networks), each computer has an IP address, a sequence of four numbers (e.g., 74.125.157.99). When computers want to communicate with each other (such as browsing to a website), they must specify the IP address of the destination. But the human brain is not very good at remembering number sequences (imagine having to remember thousands of IP addresses).<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why network scientists created the DNS protocol, which allows you to use domain names (much easier for humans to remember) to refer to computers on a network. Whenever you type in the address of a website (say en.wikipedia.org), your computer sends a DNS request to your DNS resolver (usually your internet service provider). Your resolver, in turn, communicates with a series of DNS servers to find the IP address for the website or service you want to connect to.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6143\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6143\"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"jetpack-lazy-image jetpack-lazy-image--handled wp-image-6143 size-full lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" alt=\"How does DNS work\" width=\"563\" height=\"200\" data-attachment-id=\"6143\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2019\/12\/11\/google-chrome-dns-over-https-privacy\/how-does-dns-work\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/How-does-DNS-work.png?fit=563%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"563,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"How does DNS work\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/How-does-DNS-work.png?fit=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/How-does-DNS-work.png?fit=563%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-loaded=\"1\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/How-does-DNS-work.png?resize=563%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/How-does-DNS-work.png?w=563&amp;ssl=1 563w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/How-does-DNS-work.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F16%2Fthe-pros-and-cons-of-how-google-chrome-encrypts-dns-activity%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Example of how the domain name system works (source: Wikipedia)\" data-title=\"Share Example of how the domain name system works (source: Wikipedia) on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Example of how the domain name system works (source: Wikipedia) on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Example of how the domain name system works (source: Wikipedia)<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p><\/figure><p>Here\u2019s where things get a bit ugly. The DNS request that you send is unencrypted. It contains both the domain you requested as well as a part of your own IP address. Anyone listening in on your internet traffic can log all the websites you browse to. This includes your internet service provider (ISP), the servers who route your request to DNS servers, the owner of<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2017\/02\/28\/public-wifi-security-threats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the Wi-Fi network you\u2019re using in your local coffee shop or library<\/a>, government agencies, or anyone who is crafty enough to set up a network monitoring tool.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, malicious actors can intercept the request and return a phony IP address to redirect you to a malicious website.<\/p>\n<h2>How does DNS-over-HTTPS work?<\/h2>\n<p>The basic idea behind DoH is to add a layer of encryption to your DNS request to make its contents invisible to unwanted parties. When you use DNS-over-HTTPS, your browser encrypts your DNS requests and disguises them as HTTPS packages. It then sends them to a trusted DoH resolver, which does the rest of the legwork, sending out messages to DNS servers and resolving the address of the website you want to visit.<\/p>\n<p>An eavesdropper monitoring your internet traffic won\u2019t be able to trace your DNS traffic. Also, DoH servers take precautionary measures to avoid revealing your IP address to DNS servers that resolve the address.<\/p>\n<h2>How to enable DNS-over-HTTPS on Google Chrome<\/h2>\n<p>Google added support to DNS-over-HTTPS since version 78. It is still in the experimental phase, so enabling it is not that easy. To access experimental features, you must type \u201c<strong>chrome:\/\/flags<\/strong>\u201d in the address bar.

Here are a few things to consider:<\/p>\n<p><strong>DoH will not prevent ISP tracking:<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>One of the main privacy concerns of internet users is their ISPs tracking their browsing habits and selling them to advertisers. Reading DNS requests is one of the main ways ISPs use to track your browsing. But even if they don\u2019t have access to your DNS packets, they can know which websites you\u2019re visiting because your HTTPS request will still go through them. While HTTPS encrypts request contents such as form data (username, password, addresses, phone numbers, etc.) as well as page details, it still reveals the domain of the website you\u2019re visiting.<\/p>\n<p>One consideration about this is the propagation of DoH to content delivery networks (CDNs). CDN local nodes usually host several websites on a single server, and they\u2019ll be able to use a feature called \u201cconnection coalescing\u201d to reveal less information about the domains you visit. But that hasn\u2019t happened in full yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DoH might disrupt some security tools:<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>Many endpoint security tools and smart firewalls use DNS requests to detect and prevent connections to malicious domains. DoH might disrupt the functionality of these tools.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DoH will not protect data in unencrypted websites.<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>While encrypting the web has come a long way, there are still many websites that use the unencrypted HTTP protocol. These websites expose all your information to eavesdroppers and network gateways.

There, academics, corporate researchers, and government scientists presented developments in algorithms that allow robots to make their own decisions.<\/p>\n<p>As with all technology, the range of future uses for our research is difficult to imagine. It\u2019s even more challenging to forecast given how quickly this field is changing. Take, for example, the ability for a computer to identify objects in an image: in 2010, the state of the art was successful <a href=\"https:\/\/papers.nips.cc\/paper\/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">only about half of the time<\/a>, and it was stuck there for years. Today, though, the best algorithms as shown in published papers <a href=\"https:\/\/paperswithcode.com\/sota\/image-classification-on-imagenet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">are now at 86 percent accuracy<\/a>. That advance alone allows autonomous robots to understand what they are seeing through the camera lenses. It also shows the rapid pace of progress over the past decade due to developments in AI.<\/p>\n<p>This kind of improvement is a true milestone from a technical perspective. Whereas in the past manually reviewing troves of video footage would require an incredible number of hours, now such data can be rapidly and accurately parsed by a computer program.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304561\/original\/file-20191201-156095-1ictzjm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304561\/original\/file-20191201-156095-1ictzjm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304561\/original\/file-20191201-156095-1ictzjm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304561\/original\/file-20191201-156095-1ictzjm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304561\/original\/file-20191201-156095-1ictzjm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=393&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304561\/original\/file-20191201-156095-1ictzjm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=494&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304561\/original\/file-20191201-156095-1ictzjm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=494&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304561\/original\/file-20191201-156095-1ictzjm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=494&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><\/a><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F16%2Fwhy-researchers-should-make-sure-robots-dont-become-weapons%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: San Francisco became the first U.S. city to ban the use of facial recognition technology by police and other city agencies.

They have been caught <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/checkpoint\/wp\/2017\/06\/14\/isis-drones-are-attacking-u-s-troops-and-disrupting-airstrikes-in-raqqa-officials-say\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">dropping explosives on U.S. troops<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/29\/climate-activists-plan-to-use-drones-to-shut-down-heathrow-airport-next-month\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">shutting down airports<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/08\/10\/world\/americas\/venezuela-video-analysis.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">being used in an assassination attempt on Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro<\/a>. The autonomous systems that are being developed right now could make staging such attacks easier and more devastating.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"caption\">Reports indicate that the Islamic State is using off-the-shelf drones, some of which are being used for bombings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Regulation or review boards?<\/h2>\n<p>About a year ago, a group of researchers in artificial intelligence and autonomous robotics <a href=\"https:\/\/futureoflife.org\/lethal-autonomous-weapons-pledge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">put forward a pledge<\/a> to refrain from developing lethal autonomous weapons. They defined lethal autonomous weapons as platforms that are capable of \u201cselecting and engaging targets without human intervention.\u201d As a robotics researcher who isn\u2019t interested in developing autonomous targeting techniques, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colorado.edu\/irt\/autonomous-systems\/2018\/08\/08\/cu-engineering-faculty-respond-lethal-autonomous-weapons-pledge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">I felt that the pledge missed the crux of the danger<\/a>. It glossed over important ethical questions that need to be addressed, especially those at the broad intersection of drone applications that could be either benign or violent.<\/p>\n<p>For one, the researchers, companies, and developers who wrote the papers and built the software and devices generally aren\u2019t doing it to create weapons. However, they might inadvertently enable others, with minimal expertise, to create such weapons.<\/p>\n<p>What can we do to address this risk?<\/p>\n<p>Regulation is one option, and one already used by banning aerial drones near airports or around national parks. Those are helpful, but they don\u2019t prevent the creation of weaponized drones. Traditional weapons regulations are not a sufficient template, either. They generally tighten controls on the source material or the manufacturing process. That would be nearly impossible with autonomous systems, where the source materials are widely shared computer code and the manufacturing process can take place at home using off-the-shelf components.<\/p>\n<p>Another option would be to follow in the footsteps of biologists. In 1975, they held <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC432675\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a conference on the potential hazards of recombinant DNA<\/a> at Asilomar in California. There, experts agreed to voluntary guidelines that would direct the course of future work. For autonomous systems, such an outcome seems unlikely at this point. Many research projects that could be used in the development of weapons also have peaceful and incredibly useful outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>A third choice would be to establish self-governance bodies at the organization level, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/regulatory-information\/search-fda-guidance-documents\/institutional-review-boards-frequently-asked-questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">institutional review boards<\/a> that currently oversee studies on human subjects at companies, universities and government labs. These boards consider the benefits to the populations involved in the research and craft ways to mitigate potential harms. But they can regulate only research done within their institutions, which limits their scope.<\/p>\n<p>Still, a large number of researchers would fall under these boards\u2019 purview \u2013 within the autonomous robotics research community, nearly every presenter at technical conferences are members of an institution. Research review boards would be the first step toward self-regulation and could flag projects that could be weaponized.<\/p>\n<h2>Living with the peril and promise<\/h2>\n<p>Many of my colleagues and I are excited to develop the next generation of autonomous systems. I feel that the potential for good is too promising to ignore. But I am also concerned about the risks that new technologies pose, especially if they are exploited by malicious people. Yet with some careful organization and informed conversations today, I believe we can work toward achieving those benefits while limiting the potential for harm.<!-- End of code.

That\u2019s a minor 0.39 percent increase in 24 hours, or $28. It was the highest closing price in one day.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re still 64 percent below Bitcoin\u2018s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin market cap<\/h2>\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s market cap ended the day at $129,481,424,648.

One is a protein, called Cas9, that is responsible for \u201ccutting\u201d the DNA. The other molecule is a short RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecule which works as a \u201cguide\u201d that brings Cas9 to the position where it is supposed to cut.<\/p>\n<p>The system also needs help from the cells being edited. DNA damage is frequent, so cells regularly have to repair the DNA lesions. The associated repair mechanisms are what introduce the deletions, insertions or modifications when performing gene editing.<\/p>\n<p><iframe id=\"tc-infographic-229\" class=\"tc-infographic\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.theconversation.com\/infographics\/229\/1e1ccd9abbd9a92604e144561050c08a9c49d8b3\/site\/index.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"580px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>How the genomes of Lulu and Nana were modified<\/h2>\n<p>He Jiankui and his colleagues were targeting a gene called CCR5, which is necessary for the HIV virus to enter into white blood cells (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/320987.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">lymphocytes<\/a>) and infect our body.<\/p>\n<p>One variant of CCR5, called CCR5 \u039432, is missing a particular string of 32 \u201cletters\u201d of DNA code. This variant naturally occurs in the human population, and results in a high level of resistance to the most common type of HIV virus.<\/p>\n<p>The team wanted to recreate this mutation using CRISPR on human embryos, in a bid to render them resistant to HIV infection. But this did not go as planned, and there are several ways they may have failed.<\/p>\n<p>First, despite claiming in the abstract of their unpublished article that they reproduced the human CCR5 mutation, in reality the team tried to modify CCR5 <em>close<\/em> to the \u039432 mutation.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, they generated different mutations, of which the effects are unknown. It may or may not confer HIV resistance, and may or may not have other consequences. Worryingly, they did not test any of this, and went ahead with implanting the embryos. This is unjustifiable.<\/p>\n<h2>The mosaic effect<\/h2>\n<p>A second source of errors could have been that the editing was not perfectly efficient. This means that not all cells in the embryos were necessarily edited.<\/p>\n<p>When an organism has a mixture of edited and unedited cells, it is called a \u201cmosaic\u201d. While the available data are still limited, it seems that both Lulu and Nana are mosaic.<\/p>\n<p>This makes it even less likely that the gene-edited babies would be resistant to HIV infection. The risk of mosaicism should have been another reason not to implant the embryos. Moreover, editing can have unintended impacts elsewhere in the genome.<\/p>\n<p>When designing a CRISPR experiment, you choose the \u201cguide\u201d RNA so that its sequence is unique to the gene you are targeting. However, \u201coff-target\u201d cuts can still happen elsewhere in the genome, at places that have a similar sequence.<\/p>\n<p>He Jiankui and his team tested cells from the edited embryos, and reported only one off-target modification. However, that testing required sampling the cells, which were therefore no longer part of the embryos \u2013 which continued developing. Thus, the remaining cells in the embryos had not been tested, and may have had different off-target modifications.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the team\u2019s fault, as there will always be limitations in detecting off-target and mosaicism, and we can only get a partial picture. However, that partial picture should have made them pause.<\/p>\n<h2>A bad idea to begin<\/h2>\n<p>Above, we have described several risks associated with the modifications made on the embryos, which could be passed on to future generations. Embryo editing is only ethically justifiable in cases where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Technical issues aside, the researchers did not even address an unmet medical need.<\/p>\n<p>While the twins\u2019 father was HIV-positive, there is already a well-established way to prevent an HIV-positive father from infecting embryos. This \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4779710\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">sperm washing<\/a>\u201d method was actually used by the team.<\/p>\n<p>The only benefit of the attempted gene modification, if proven, would have been a reduced risk of HIV infection for the twins later in life. But there are safer existing ways to control the risk of infection, such as condoms and mandatory testing of blood donations.<\/p>\n<h2>Implications for gene editing as a field<\/h2>\n<p>Gene editing has endless applications. It can be used to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-02770-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">make plants such as the Cavendish banana more resistant to devastating diseases<\/a>. It can play an important role in the adaptation to climate change.<\/p>\n<p>In health, we are already seeing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2019\/11\/19\/780510277\/gene-edited-supercells-make-progress-in-fight-against-sickle-cell-disease\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">promising results<\/a> with the editing of somatic cells (that is, non-heritable modifications of the patient\u2019s own cells) in beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.<\/p>\n<p>However, we are just not ready for human embryo editing. Our techniques are not mature enough, and no case has been made for a widespread need that other techniques, such as preimplantation genetic testing, could not address.<\/p>\n<p>There is also much work still needed on governance. There have been individual calls for a moratorium on embryo editing, and expert panels from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-00942-z\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">World Health Organization<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.unesco.org\/news\/unesco-panel-experts-calls-ban-editing-human-dna-avoid-unethical-tampering-hereditary-traits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">UNESCO<\/a>\u00a0\u2014 yet, no consensus has emerged.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important these discussions move <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-03525-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">in unison<\/a> to a second phase, where other stakeholders, such as patient groups, are more broadly consulted (and informed).

And one of the best companies in this space? Ultimate Ears.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been a huge fan\u00a0of their speakers for some time \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/02\/15\/love-letter-boom-3-bluetooth-speaker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I even wrote a love letter to one<\/a> \u2014 but one of the company\u2019s most impressive new models is the Wonderboom 2. When I reviewed the Bluetooth speaker, <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/07\/24\/review-ue-wonderboom-2-bluetooth-speaker-summer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I came away gushing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I adored the Wonderboom 2 at its normal price ($80), but it\u2019s gotten even better <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anrdoezrs.net\/links\/8824894\/type\/dlg\/https:\/\/www.google.com\/shopping\/product\/12232013349234550324?psb=1&amp;tbm=shop&amp;prds=epd%3A8025978513459914069%2Cprmr%3A3&amp;ved=0CAAQ0FUoIGoXChMIrtmepNey5gIVHg6zAB3z8AnZEHc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">now you can pick this lovely thing up for only $50<\/a>. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a goddamn bargain.<\/p>\n<p>Because videos are cool, I\u2019ve even gone on YouTube and found the marketing content of your dreams. Have a look at this:<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nTIfWTv9QG0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Basically, the Wonderboom 2 is a compact speaker that sounds great and is perfect for, well, basically anywhere you\u2019d like to listen to some music. Is it going to fill a concert hall? Probably not. But is it great for listening to at the park? Or in the garden? Or in the shower? You\u2019re damn right it is.<\/p>\n<p>The Wonderboom 2 is tough, rugged speaker that is a perfect day-to-day companion. Considering its size, it also sounds great, with more bass than you\u2019d expect, and a rich, luxurious balance to the sound it creates.<\/p>\n<p>I considered the Wonderboom 2 a must buy at $80, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anrdoezrs.net\/links\/8824894\/type\/dlg\/https:\/\/www.google.com\/shopping\/product\/12232013349234550324?psb=1&amp;tbm=shop&amp;prds=epd%3A8025978513459914069%2Cprmr%3A3&amp;ved=0CAAQ0FUoIGoXChMIrtmepNey5gIVHg6zAB3z8AnZEHc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">so now it\u2019s down to $50<\/a>, it\u2019s, uh, an even more must buy? I dunno, I\u2019m hungover. Just buy the damn thing if you want a top quality portable speaker. That is all.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>This post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.

I\u2019d never told anyone at Skookum, actually.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p id=\"0770\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Not because I was ashamed or embarrassed \u2014 it had simply never come up. Not once in interviews, onboarding, or casual conversation \u2014 until this conversation, at least.

I was only an intern at the time, but I would later become a full-time employee. Degrees didn\u2019t appear to be something that the decision-makers cared about, which was surprising to me.<\/p>\n<p id=\"18a9\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I guess I was surprised mainly because growing up; it had been drilled into my head (mostly by teachers and my friend\u2019s parents) that the only way to get a good job was to go to college. It wasn\u2019t that I believed them; it was just I thought it would be more challenging than it was and has been to build a career in design without a degree.<\/p>\n<p class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Colleges have historically struggled to keep up with the pace of technology. For this reason, all of the designers I know, whether they attended college for design or not, are self-taught in some regard. If designers had to go back to school to get a certificate every time a new update for Sketch was released, then design and UX would progress at a snail-like pace.<\/p>\n<p class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But the world of design moves faster than ever. What is relevant today will be old news tomorrow. The design tool or trend people are gawking at today will be replaced with a new one in a short amount of time. The benefit of working in tech is things move fast, and the only way to keep up is to be continually learning.<\/p>\n<p id=\"d5a6\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Luckily, it\u2019s 2019, so there are thousands upon thousands of online resources, articles, courses, tutorials, and content available for free or cheap to help us keep up\u00a0with the changes. With the rapid rate at which design standards change and new tools, disciplines, or best practices are introduced, it\u2019s no wonder the majority of tech companies aren\u2019t asking for college degrees.<\/p>\n<p id=\"01d5\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If we look at Facebook, for example, a quick skim through their job listing for \u2018Product Designer\u2019 shows no mention of a degree of any kind anywhere.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gx\">\n<div class=\"n p\">\n<div class=\"hm hn ho hp hq hr ag hs ah ht aj ak\">\n<figure class=\"hv hw hx hy hz gx ia ib paragraph-image\"><div class=\"gy gz bl ha ak\">\n<div class=\"eq er jc\">\n<div class=\"hf r bl hg\">\n<div class=\"jd r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"pi qx cr t u hc ak hl lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"2104\" height=\"612\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1894\/1*OMdHf3FXd3cpsd-R1e7Y3w.png\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F15%2Fyou-probably-dont-need-a-degree-to-be-a-ui-ux-designer%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Facebook\u2019s Product Design job posting,\u00a0Menlo Park\" data-title=\"Share Facebook\u2019s Product Design job posting,\u00a0Menlo Park on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Facebook\u2019s Product Design job posting,\u00a0Menlo Park on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Facebook\u2019s Product Design job posting,\u00a0Menlo Park<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"n p\">\n<div class=\"ac ae af ag ah ez aj ak\">\n<p id=\"574a\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">And it\u2019s not just Facebook.

I\u2019m sure others have this requirement, but I had trouble finding them while browsing job boards.

Luckily, this appears to be the norm. Companies hire good designers, not bad designers with degrees.<\/p>\n<p id=\"34eb\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you\u2019re a good designer who has a degree, then that\u2019s great! You\u2019re in a much better position when applying for jobs. If you\u2019re a bad designer with a degree, then it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re a lousy designer. In addition to being a well-rounded designer with experience solving complex problems, companies are looking for candidates who\u2019ll be a good culture fit, collaborate well with their team, and someone who is business-minded.<\/p>\n<p id=\"cb94\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Communication skills are frequently mentioned in job postings as well as more straightforward skills like fluency in design programs such as Sketch, Figma, Framer, XD, and the Adobe suite.\u00a0Companies want to see a wealth of experience and diverse projects in your portfolio. They want to see you solving unique problems and demonstrating strong visual and UX skills.<\/p>\n<p id=\"2c95\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Having a user-centric approach to problem-solving through research and user testing is also something that will set you apart in an interview.\u00a0Companies want someone that demonstrates being a do-it-yourselfer. Someone who is passionate about design and is working on design in some manner, continually. A person with a quest for constant improvement.<\/p>\n<p id=\"b86f\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">That means someone working on side projects, doing illustration challenges, making animations for fun, picking up freelance work on the side, or reading design books on the bus to work.

Ambitious learners can now turn to places like<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo ga ii ij ik il\" href=\"https:\/\/uxdesign.cc\/10-things-that-helped-me-improve-as-a-ui-designer-78d3f551372\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">YouTube and Medium to learn in-demand skills for free<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>or for cheap.<\/p>\n<p id=\"e96d\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At the same time, college is more expensive than ever and only getting more expensive. The average price of college in the US has<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo ga ii ij ik il\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/11\/29\/how-much-college-tuition-has-increased-from-1988-to-2018.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">gone up 163 percent since 1988<\/a>. In comparison, a 1-month membership to<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo ga ii ij ik il\" href=\"http:\/\/learnux.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LearnUX.io<\/a>, a well-respected resource for designers, is a mere $15. Meanwhile, the average college student spends more than<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo ga ii ij ik il\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/whats-behind-the-soaring-cost-of-college-textbooks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">$1,200 on books and materials, according to the College Board<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"0783\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The average student debt was<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo ga ii ij ik il\" href=\"https:\/\/www.debt.org\/students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">$37,172 in 2017<\/a>. On top of the high price tag, it takes on average four years for students to obtain a degree. Personally, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve spent less than $1,500 in my entire career on design resources and tools. That includes software, books, resources, courses, and design plugins. I also was able to learn UI\/UX at a proficient level in less than two years.<\/p>\n<p id=\"3018\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Let\u2019s say the worst case, it takes someone two years of busting their ass trying to learn product design and ending up with $2-$5k in debt, and they\u2019re unable to find a job. If this is the worst-case\u00a0scenario, then it\u2019s an easy recovery. Yes, they\u2019ve wasted time and money, but they\u2019ve certainly learned something in this process that can be applied to almost any other profession in tech.<\/p>\n<p id=\"5126\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The college grad, however, is burdened with almost $40k in debt, likely has bad credit because of it, and still only able to start their career in UI\/UX at the ground level with an entry-level position. If they\u2019re unable to find a job, then it\u2019s much less of an easy recovery.<\/p>\n<p class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">My point with this article is not to knock anyone who went to school for design. There is\u00a0undoubtable value that can be derived from that experience.\u00a0School can teach you the fundamentals of design and the soft skills that are essential for any designer.\u00a0School can also help give you thicker skin through defending your decisions in design critiques and other experiences that are less common for self-taught designers.<\/p>\n<p id=\"03f4\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It can be easy to lose motivation when learning a new skill on your own, and it\u2019s less enjoyable without that collaborative environment to lean on. There are also numerous networking and career-building opportunities afforded to college students that would be hard to acquire on your own.<\/p>\n<p id=\"64f4\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I don\u2019t want to downplay the benefits of a college education; I\u2019m aware there are numerous. However, if we are looking logically at the facts, it is the most expensive way to get into product design with no guarantees of a payoff.<\/p>\n<p id=\"a686\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When looking at cost, time, and value, we aren\u2019t comparing apples to apples. We\u2019re comparing $37,172 for college to $2,000 (at the high end) to learn on one\u2019s own accord. We\u2019re comparing an average of a 4\u20136-year time investment for college to 1\u20132 years to do it on your own. If being self-taught isn\u2019t something that you feel is a good fit for you, and college is too expensive, then boot camp is the next cheapest option.<\/p>\n<p id=\"db48\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I wrote an in-depth article about the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo ga ii ij ik il\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.prototypr.io\/is-the-general-assembly-ux-course-worth-14-000-c3aa52d60aa?source=---------10------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">pros and cons of going to General Assembly<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>for UX that I recommend reading if you\u2019re in that boat. The main message I want to convey here is that you can take many routes and end up at the same destination. There is no one size fits all approach, and there is no blueprint for success in such a diverse industry like design.<\/p>\n<p id=\"6523\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you\u2019re at the beginning of your journey and seeking the optimal path, then know that attending college for design is one option, but it isn\u2019t essential to becoming a UI\/UX designer. I\u2019d urge you to evaluate your options and find the path that works for you to get into this field. Ignore the gatekeepers telling you that there\u2019s only one prescriptive approach for success.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8ac6\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There will be people that tell you that you need to go to boot camp or design school to be a great designer. There will also be people that tell you that being self-taught will make you more creative and unique. Some will tell you that it\u2019s not easy to get into this industry, and you need to have a natural talent or ability \u2014 but it\u2019s all false.<\/p>\n<p id=\"168f\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">People who say things like that are just insecure about themselves and are worried that if other people enter the industry that it will threaten their position. Anyone with the ambition and motivation to become a UI\/UX designer can learn for free or less than the cost of an average college class in 2 years or less.<\/p>\n<p id=\"91b0\" class=\"im in fi ar io b ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you\u2019re willing to be an autodidact and push your creative limits daily, then you\u2019ll fit in just fine, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. A career in product design isn\u2019t rocket surgery \u2014 it\u2019s practice, and it\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em><span class=\"title\">This article was originally published on <a href=\"https:\/\/uxdesign.cc\/do-you-need-a-degree-to-be-a-ui-ux-designer-758e9ab0c146\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">uxdesign.cc<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/uxdesign.cc\/@dansapio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Danny\u00a0Sapio<\/a>, a\u00a0Product Designer at Skookum, Entrepreneur, and Ph\u1edf Enthusiast in Denver, CO.

        "content": "<p>Artificial Intelligence may be one of the greatest technologies developed by humans. The quest for imitating human intelligence might not be a hundred percent accurate. But, it\u2019s pretty helpful in shifting the existing burden of humans to an extent and developing devices that can work independently without the intervention of human beings.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since its inception, artificial intelligence has come a long way to become what it is today. It\u2019s expanded its domain and gave subfields such as machine learning a great chance to thrive in the world. Name any sector today, artificial intelligence has been able to penetrate it and create an impact for good. Be it a business where AI is used to understand the customer and automate several business processes to education, where it has paved the way for smart learning. However, one of the most radical transformations has been observed in the field of healthcare.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>The healthcare sector is benefiting a lot from the implementation of AI in several of its core processes. On the one hand, it\u2019s helping researchers collaborate in a better environment, making space for innovation. While on the other hand, it\u2019s aiding doctors to make better decisions regarding a patient\u2019s health. This is especially working wonders after the adoption of digitization by the healthcare industry. Today, patient records are going online and the data from wearable devices are being monitored in real-time. When combined with AI, this is paving a way for devices that can monitor a patient\u2019s health closely and inform them before a healthcare situation escalates any further \u2014 we are in an era of preventive medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, another use case of AI is being observed in the domain of healthcare diagnosis. With increasing diseases and them taking different forms to remain undiagnosed through normal devices, patients are always under risk. AI, on the other hand, can generate better diagnostic services without rising the costs so that the population from every corner of the country can take advantage of it.<\/p>\n<h2>AI for maternity care<\/h2>\n<p>One of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence is its use for maternity care. While traditional sonography technique still exist, there was a need to come up with better analysis to understand child development. It would also lead to the understanding of any underlying situations in the pregnancy that needed immediate attention of the doctors.<\/p>\n<p>Recent research by the Pennsylvania State University revealed the magical use case of artificial intelligence in analyzing placentas. Once the child is conceived, the placenta provides all the key information related to the health of the mother and baby. In spite of being such a great asset to understanding the phenomenon of birth, only 20 percent of the placentas are accessed by pathology exams after delivery in the US. Even for these twenty percent, the cost, time, and other resources are exhaustive.<\/p>\n<p>Alison Gernand, the Assistant Professor of Nutritional Sciences at the Penn State\u2019s College of Health and Human Development pointed out the fact that placentas drive everything to do with pregnancy for the mother and the progeny. But, currently, the world is missing out on placenta data for as many as 95 percent of the births globally. Therefore, there was an urgent need to create a process that requires fewer resources and allows researchers to gather more comprehensive data. This would help in examining how placentas are directly linked to maternal and fetal health outcomes. It would also pave a way for diagnosing placentas in minutes rather than days and without the need for any special equipment.<\/p>\n<p>The novel solution which is currently being developed comprehensively could produce a more accurate, automated and near-immediate placental diagnosis. All this is possible through artificial intelligence\u2019s domain of computerized photographic image analysis. This initiative could also allow the diagnosis of all placentas, and in turn, reduce the number of placentas that are sent for intensive pathological examinations and creating a less resource-intensive path for the analysis. In other words, AI would help in a hassle-free examination of placentas in the least amount of time making it accessible to everyone out there.<\/p>\n<h2>How does computerized image analysis help?<\/h2>\n<p>The technology in the research quintessentially uses artificial intelligence to analyze the image of each side of the placenta after delivery. It then produces a report of the critical information that could have an impact on the clinical care of the mother and child. For example, computerized image analysis can help in knowing whether the fetus was getting enough oxygen in the womb or if there is a risk of infection and bleeding.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers analyzed close to 13,000 high-quality images of placentas along with their corresponding pathology reports from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. In the first step, the researchers labeled a training set of images with critical data points to understand the placenta. These points included areas of incompleteness and umbilical cord insertion points.<\/p>\n<p>These images were then used to train a neural network using the GPU and CPU servers. With this, the machine could automatically analyze new images of the placenta and detect features linked to abnormality and potential health risks. The system was soon able to produce predictions on the unlabeled images efficiently, However, the authenticity of the study was checked when comparisons of the system produced predictions were made with the original pathology reports.<\/p>\n<p>Even though there has been some past research in the field, the computerized image analysis model harnesses the best of artificial intelligence along with a comprehensive dataset to make multiple decisions at the same time. All this was possible by treating different parts of the placenta as complimentary. Ultimately the goal of the AI study is not to replace pathologists but to assist them to make better and faster decisions so the mother and child receive adequate healthcare support when needed. The study can be further advanced to provide long term care for the mother and child during pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">This article was originally published on Towards Data Science by\u00a0<span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/@james_52456?source=post_page-----bf436df6d9da----------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">James Warner<\/a><\/span>, a b<span>usiness intelligence analyst with knowledge on Hadoop\/Big data analysis at NexSoftSys.com\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>",

The technique has a potent claim on our imaginations.<\/p>\n<p>These images are usually produced when other identification methods have failed. It\u2019s usually a last resort with very high stakes. This is perhaps why, when forensic depictions lead to recognition in spite of their own technical limitations, it can feel like a miracle, providing an essential, often long-awaited, piece of an investigative puzzle.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Facial reconstruction becomes most culturally visible when it is applied to <a href=\"http:\/\/archaeologicalmuseum.jhu.edu\/the-collection\/object-stories\/who-am-i-remembering-the-dead-through-facial-reconstruction\/the-facial-reconstruction-process\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">archaeological research<\/a>. Depicting past people enables viewers to imagine them as individuals rather than specimens. The facial image becomes a powerful and complex medium, fostering connections between historical events and personal lifeways, and re-establishing a degree of personhood.<\/p>\n<p>This research is facilitated by advances in imaging technologies, and benefits from interdisciplinary input. In turn, it creates new opportunities for the retrieval of previously unknown or suppressed knowledge that reshapes our understanding of the past.<\/p>\n<p>What has become known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.news.uct.ac.za\/features\/sutherland\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sutherland Reburial project<\/a> offers a unique opportunity to reflect on the objectives of recreating faces from skulls. The project involved creating facial depictions based on <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/skeletons-and-closets-how-one-university-reburied-the-dead-126607\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">human remains unethically acquired<\/a> by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uct.ac.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">University of Cape Town<\/a> in the 1920s.<\/p>\n<p>The project has become a platform to ventilate the unfinished business of human remains discovered from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sahistory.org.za\/article\/khoikhoi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">South Africa\u2019s unpleasant past<\/a>. It has also set a precedent for repatriation and restitution initiatives. The most critical is the involvement of direct descendants with links to the farm where the majority of these remains were exhumed, and their specific request to \u201csee the faces\u201d of their ancestors. Giving us their permission with their instruction, they collaborated in producing scientific knowledge for the benefit of the source community in Sutherland.<\/p>\n<p>The project has also demonstrated how science, art and technology converge in contemporary facial reconstruction and depiction.<\/p>\n<h2>How it\u2019s done<\/h2>\n<p>At the start of May 2019, the project was undertaken by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ljmu.ac.uk\/research\/centres-and-institutes\/institute-of-art-and-technology\/expertise\/face-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Face Lab<\/a>, recognized as an international leader in craniofacial research and analysis, with an entirely digital workflow.<\/p>\n<p>Facial reconstruction interprets the details of the skull to recreate face shape through modeling of facial soft tissues, estimating the shape and size of facial features and using methods developed over a century of scientific and artistic collaboration.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007\/s12024-006-0007-9.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Current methods<\/a> have shown that shape can be accurately recreated with less than 2mm of error for approximately 70 percent of the facial surface.<\/p>\n<p>The surface details of a face, known here as \u201ctexture\u201d, are a matter of interpretation. Eye and hair colour, skin tone, wrinkles, scars and other marks, and some aspects of the ear cannot be reliably predicted from the skull alone. <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosgenetics\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pgen.1004224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Genetic phenotyping<\/a> is making some advances here, but not without <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/10\/19\/nyregion\/dna-phenotyping-new-york-police.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">significant controversy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Yet these details are essential for creating a plausible face, so we must make a reasonable attempt, restricted by what can be justified by the available data.<\/p>\n<p>In Face Lab, we refer to the final result as a \u201cdepiction\u201d to distinguish between the process of recreating face shape \u2013 informed by anatomical standards that apply across all populations \u2013 and the highly interpretive process of adding surface details. The final depiction should employ visual strategies known to optimize recognition, but also infer ambiguity where necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Our job is therefore to predict the \u201cmost likely\u201d in-life appearance of an individual by attending as closely as possible to the specific, not the average. Producing the right sort of face, with the features in a certain proportional and spatial relationship to each other, determined by a skull\u2019s own architecture, is what narrows the search for an unidentified victim in a forensic context.<\/p>\n<p>Refining individualizing detail \u2013 a gap between the upper teeth, prominent ears, a crooked nose or asymmetric eyes \u2013 increases the chances of successful recognition.<\/p>\n<h2>In the lab<\/h2>\n<p>Face Lab worked with 3D digital models of the Sutherland skulls produced from CT scans, which provided excellent surface detail along with internal information that refined feature prediction and allowed estimation of missing jawbones (mandibles). This was necessary for three individuals in this group.<\/p>\n<p>Where bony fragments were missing or damaged, reassembly was a necessary first step. The more bone is absent, the more qualified the final result.<\/p>\n<p>Face Lab employs a 3D modeling program with a haptic (touch-sensitive) interface. This process non-destructively mimics a manual sculpting process, enabling optimal preservation of fragile or damaged bone by building up the soft tissues of the face in virtual clay. Rendering the various layers transparent to view the underlying skeletal structure at any time during the process enables continual evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>Extensive visual research guided our final presentation choices for the Sutherland faces. This was supported by information from within the team, including ancient DNA which confirmed biological sex in some cases, as well as kinship and geographical origins.<\/p>\n<p>Clothing was suggested based on contemporaneous archival photographs taken in the same broad geographical area. Adding a sepia tint introduced an element of color in keeping with 19th century photographic techniques and visually situates them in the period in which the majority lived.We chose to present these people as they most likely would have appeared at their approximate age at death. The environment in which they lived and their likely lifestyle \u2013 harsh weather, basic diet and physical labour \u2013 would have affected their appearance. Older adults would have likely had more heavily wrinkled skin than contemporary people of the same chronological age.<\/p>\n<p>They are historical interpretations produced with forensic fealty.<\/p>\n<h2>Unnerving reality<\/h2>\n<p>Presenting the images to the families evoked complex emotions, from intense curiosity to guarded apprehension. The level of realism was clearly unnerving, but ultimately compelling.<\/p>\n<p>The faces were ciphers for a process of recognition that was about being seen and heard.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304423\/original\/file-20191129-95242-1p4tptq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304423\/original\/file-20191129-95242-1p4tptq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304423\/original\/file-20191129-95242-1p4tptq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304423\/original\/file-20191129-95242-1p4tptq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304423\/original\/file-20191129-95242-1p4tptq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304423\/original\/file-20191129-95242-1p4tptq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304423\/original\/file-20191129-95242-1p4tptq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304423\/original\/file-20191129-95242-1p4tptq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><\/a><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F14%2Fart-and-technology-can-reconstruct-the-faces-of-the-dead-based-on-remains%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Showing the families the facial reconstructions of their ancestors previously buried on Kruisrivier farm in Sutherland.

        "content": "<p>It\u2019s not very often that I get to go to live, gaming-based events without having to leave my home territory of North Texas. I got an invite to the \u201cOscars of Esports,\u201d the Esports Awards \u2014 to be held in Arlington. For those of you who don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw from where I live. So I was able to attend for the first time, and I\u2019m so glad this glitzy event came to Texas.<\/p>\n<p>The Esports Awards have been around for a good few years now, but they\u2019ve been hosted in London. But this year a change of venue was in order, and the event moved to the Esports Stadium in Arlington. I dusted off my good dress and a notepad and sallied forth.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>I\u2019m sure, when most of you think of esports at all, you\u2019re not necessarily associating it with Arlington, Texas. But the stadium there is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sportsvideo.org\/2019\/01\/24\/inside-esports-stadium-arlington-north-americas-largest-and-most-flexible-esports-venue\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the largest dedicated esports space<\/a> in North America, and was built specifically to attract this sort of event. I got the chance to briefly speak to Esports Awards CEO Tom Mercey and he also seemed excited about the new location. The stadium, which was completed in November 2018, is 100,000 square feet and features gaming stations open to the public, in addition to the competitive space.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not exactly sure what I was expecting, going into the event. It probably wasn\u2019t a relatively ritzy black tie event. While I\u2019d be among the first to defend esports as an actual sport rather than some amateur\u2019s hobby \u2014 a stereotype many pros still have to contend with \u2014 I think the glamour of it was a little more than even I expected. It\u2019s quite a thing to rub elbows with presenters in floor-length gowns and black ties who\u2019re also excitedly snapping pics with a Reinhardt cosplayer.<\/p>\n<p>The show didn\u2019t go completely without a hitch. Presenters weren\u2019t cued for their entrances, while at least one winner walked off without their award. And I\u2019m still trying to figure out why the deserts were served to us on ceramic floor tiles, but then again\u00a0I\u2019ll take a cannoli no matter what kind of plate it\u2019s on.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of minor observations while I\u2019m thinking about it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fortnite World Cup winner Bugha is a doll, remaining humble as he accepted two awards and one of the hosts not-so-subtly reminded everyone he took home a $3 million pot with his win.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m terrible at recognizing people in person despite ostensibly seeing them on Twitter or on streams. At least three times during the night I said hi to someone and only after walking away either realized or was told that they were someone I should have recognized on sight. Take from that either that my memory for faces retains as much as a rusted sieve, or people really look that different in person.<\/li>\n<li>The sole exception to this was Dr. Disrespect, though I suspect it was only his height that helped jog my lone brain cell. His wife was kind enough to listen to the joke I\u2019d told at his expense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I got home with my goodie bag around one in the morning, and was rather pleased to discover it included a Red Bull. I was definitely going to need it to struggle out of bed the next morning. I\u2019m not as young as I used to be.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>BenQ has, perhaps quietly, made a name for itself as one of the best in the business when it comes to home theater projectors. Recently, I got my hands on the HT5550, the brighter and beefier twin to the popular HT3550. And while it\u2019s a bit on the lighter side of features when compared to similarly priced competitors in this space, it\u2019s aces in terms of performance.<\/p>\n<h2>Highlights<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>HDR10, Hybrid Log Gamma<\/li>\n<li>300\u201d max image size<\/li>\n<li>1.36-2.18 throw ratio<\/li>\n<li>60%\/23% lens shift (horizontal\/vertical)<\/li>\n<li>1800 Lumens<\/li>\n<li>4,000-15,000 lamp life<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I first took an interest in BenQ when I got to sit down with the HT2550 Ultra HD Projector which was, and still is, one of the best options on the lower end of the pricing scale. It features a sharp image and solid accuracy, but lacked the extended color gamut of its two newest models: the HT3550, and HT550. These, of course, make up the mid-range of BenQ\u2019s offerings, called the CinePrime line.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<h2>Unboxing and first impressions<\/h2>\n<p>Out of the box you\u2019ll get a generous 60 percent vertical shift and 1.6x zoom range, which should make it a breeze to center on a projector screen. In my experience, however, this wasn\u2019t the case. Getting it perfectly centered proved to be impossible with the BenQ ceiling mount bracket, so I\u2019m stuck \u2014 after hours of playing with it \u2014 with a slightly off-center picture where the top right or bottom left corner can never seem to line up just right.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1262302 size-featured_img lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"796\" height=\"419\" sizes=\"(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/projector3-796x419.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/projector3-796x419.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/projector3-280x148.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/projector3-513x270.jpg 513w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/projector3-256x135.jpg 256w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/projector3-1592x839.jpg 1592w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fplugged%2F2019%2F12%2F13%2Freview-benqs-ht5550-ultra-hd-projector-is-pricy-but-nearly-perfect%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: This ceiling mount exists to make my life miserable\" data-title=\"Share This ceiling mount exists to make my life miserable on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share This ceiling mount exists to make my life miserable on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>This ceiling mount exists to make my life miserable<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>A mechanical option, something with a bit more \u201cclickiness\u201d rather than the manual, free-floating adjustments of the BenQ ceiling mount would work wonders here. To use the bracket, you must first pull a tab, which loosens the hold slightly on the projector itself and allows you to move it. Unfortunately, incremental adjustments are a nightmare since you have to push the tab back in after you get it perfectly aligned, which seems to always move the projector out of the sweet spot you had previously dialed in. Maybe someone with more patience, or hours of time, could have figured out a way to get it just right, but I wasn\u2019t able to. That said, we\u2019re talking a nearly imperceptible difference between perfectly center that none of my friends has noticed \u2014 but it still drives me a bit crazy from time-to-time.<\/p>\n<p>This may be the only time you\u2019ll wish the HT5550 was more like its cheaper counterpart, the 3550. This model is perfectly suited for mounting on a table or as a portable display. The beefy 5550 is better when mounted.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s not ideal, the blame here falls on the bracket more than the projector, although additional options for centering on the HT5550 could solve some of these issues.<\/p>\n<p>The projector itself is an Ultra HD marvel. The 4K resolution is crisp and the single-chip DLP design leads to a super-fast response time that feels cinema quality.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery\" tabindex=\"100\" id=\"gallery-707077\"><div

3550, and features a center-mounted lens with an all-glass, low dispersion design that really makes the most of its 1800 ANSI lumens. It\u2019s calibrated out of the box, but the instruction manual can help with some fine-tuning, as well as the optimal viewing distances for both SDR and HDR signals.<\/p>\n<p>The large rings surrounding the glass control focus and zoom. Shift controls are on top. On the right side is the exhaust port, which houses a whisper quiet fan. I barely noticed it and forgot about it entirely after a few minutes. Unfortunately, this vent also leads to a bit of light leakage, but it\u2019s not substantial enough to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>It does tend to get a bit hot, like most electronics. You\u2019ll want to give it some breathing room.<\/p>\n<p>In the rear, there\u2019s the connection panel. Here you\u2019ll find two HDMI 2.0 ports with HDCP 2.2. There\u2019s a USB port for streaming media (or powering connected devices). Additionally, you\u2019ll find a 3.5mm output. There are no built-in speakers.

For our purposes, that of the everyday user, the eye test is best. And it passed that one with flying colors.<\/p>\n<p>Planet Earth II in Ultra HD was nothing short of an experience on a 125-inch screen from Elite Screens. Each scene provided a look at what happens when 4K and HDR is pushed to its limits, providing vivid color and impressive detail that you really have to see to appreciate. It makes me excited for what 8K will bring once we start seeing a wider rollout of capable devices (and programming).<\/p>\n<p>Faster-paced action movies, like Avengers Infinity War, tend to make or break projectors due to the speed at which everything unfolds. We noticed no artifacts or blurring and the projector performed as good or better as any that we\u2019ve seen. Colors, again, were rich and vibrant, and the resolution was out of this world.<\/p>\n<p>As for gaming, the HT5550 performed admirably. Faster-paced games, shooters, specifically, will introduce the occasional screen artifact or a slight blur, but it\u2019s not enough to ruin the experience. Other titles, like <em>Breath of the Wild<\/em> or <em>FIFA<\/em> were as enjoyable an experience as we\u2019ve had \u2014 there\u2019s nothing like scoring on Real Madrid on a 125-inch screen.<\/p>\n<p>The only hurdle you\u2019ll face with this, or any projector, really, is light. All projectors look best in a dark room. The darker the better. And although the room it was installed in gets a fair amount of natural light, the projector still performed admirably, and was watchable at all hours. That said, nighttime viewing is still where you\u2019ll get the biggest bang for the buck with this, or any other projector.<\/p>\n<p>That really only leaves one question: is it worth the $2,700 price tag? And the answer isn\u2019t so simple. The HT3550 provides most of what you\u2019ll want, and it\u2019s quite a bit cheaper. We did enjoy our time with the HT5550 though, and if it\u2019s within your budget, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it. As with all home theater equipment it really comes down to how serious you are about the experience, and how much you\u2019re willing to pay to get it.<\/p>\n<p>Is the HT5550 worth the price for someone looking for an exceptional experience? Absolutely. It\u2019s arguably the best offering in this price range.<\/p><p><i>For more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/plugged\">Twitter<\/a> and\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/flipboard.com\/@thenextweb\/plugged-54nihknvy\">Flipboard<\/a>.\n            <\/i><\/p>",

The good news is that the threat of biased AI and Orwellian surveillance systems no longer hangs over our collective heads like an artificial Sword of Damocles. The bad news: the threat\u2019s gone because it\u2019s become our reality. Welcome to 1984.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>The annual report from AI Now is a deep-dive into the industry conducted by the <a href=\"https:\/\/ainowinstitute.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">AI Now Institute<\/a> at New York University. Its focused on the social impact that AI use has on humans, communities, and the population at large. It sources information and analysis from experts in myriad disciplines around the world and works closely with partners throughout the IT, legal, and civil rights communities.<\/p>\n<p>This year\u2019s report begins with twelve recommendations based on the institute\u2019s conclusions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regulators should ban the use of affect recognition in important decisions that impact people\u2019s lives and access to opportunities.<\/li>\n<li>Government and business should halt all use of facial recognition in sensitive social and political contexts until the risks are fully studied and adequate regulations are in place.<\/li>\n<li>The AI industry needs to make significant structural changes to address systemic racism, misogyny, and lack of diversity.<\/li>\n<li>AI bias research should move beyond technical fixes to address the broader politics and consequences of AI\u2019s use.<\/li>\n<li>Governments should mandate public disclosure of the AI industry\u2019s climate impact.<\/li>\n<li>Workers should have the right to contest exploitative and invasive AI\u2014and unions can help.<\/li>\n<li>Tech workers should have the right to know what they are building and to contest unethical or harmful uses of their work.<\/li>\n<li>States should craft expanded biometric privacy laws that regulate both public and private actors.<\/li>\n<li>Lawmakers need to regulate the integration of public and private surveillance infrastructures.<\/li>\n<li>Algorithmic Impact Assessments must account for AI\u2019s impact on climate, health, and geographical displacement.<\/li>\n<li>Machine learning researchers should account for potential risks and harms and better document the origins of their models and data.<\/li>\n<li>Lawmakers should require informed consent for use of any personal data in health-related AI.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The permeating theme here seems to be that corporations and governments need to stop passing the buck when it comes to social and ethical accountability. A lack of regulation and ethical oversight has lead to a near total surveillance state in the US. And the use of black box systems throughout the judiciary and financial systems has proliferated even though such AI has been proven to be inherently biased.<\/p>\n<p>AI Now notes that these entities saw a significant amount of push-back from activist groups and pundits, but also points out that this has done relatively little to stem the flow of harmful AI:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite growing public concern and regulatory action, the roll-out of facial recognition and other risky AI technologies has barely slowed down. So-called \u201csmart city\u201d projects around the world are consolidating power over civic life in the hands of for-profit technology companies, putting them in charge of managing critical resources and information.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Google\u2019s Sidewalk Labs project even promoted the creation of a Google-managed citizen credit score as part of its plan for public-private partnerships like Sidewalk Toronto. And Amazon heavily marketed its Ring, an AI-enabled home-surveillance video camera. The company partnered with over 700 police departments, using police as salespeople to convince residents to buy the system. In exchange, law enforcement was granted easier access to Ring surveillance footage.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are fighting to be first in line for massive government contracts to grow the use of AI for tracking and surveillance of refugees and residents, along with the proliferation of biometric identity systems, contributing to the overall surveillance infrastructure run by private tech companies and made available to governments.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The report also gets into \u201caffect recognition\u201d AI, a subset of facial recognition that\u2019s made its way into schools and businesses around the world. Companies use it during job interviews to, supposedly, tell if an applicant is being truthful and on production floors to determine who is being productive and attentive. It\u2019s a bunch of crap though, as a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/stoken\/default+domain\/10.1177%2F1529100619832930-FREE\/pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">comprehensive review<\/a> of research from multiple teams concluded.<\/p>\n<p>Per the AI Now 2019 report:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Critics also noted the similarities between the logic of affect recognition, in which personal worth and character are supposedly discernible from physical characteristics, and discredited race science and physiognomy, which was used to claim that biological differences justified social inequality. Yet in spite of this, AI-enabled affect recognition continues to be deployed at scale across environments from classrooms to job interviews, informing sensitive determinations about who is \u201cproductive\u201d or who is a \u201cgood worker,\u201d often without people\u2019s knowledge.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>At this point, it seems any company that develops or deploys AI technology that can be used to discriminate \u2013 especially black box technology that claims to understand what a person is thinking or feeling \u2013 is willfully investing in discrimination. We\u2019re long past the time that corporations and governments can feign ignorance on the matter.<\/p>\n<p>This is especially true when it comes to surveillance. In the US, like China, we\u2019re now under constant public and private surveillance. Cameras record our every move in public at work, in our schools, and in our own neighborhoods. And, worst of all, not only did the government use our tax dollars to pay for all of it,\u00a0millions of us unwittingly purchased, mounted, and maintained the surveillance gear ourselves. AI Now wrote:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amazon exemplified this new wave of commercial surveillance tech with Ring, a smart-security-device company acquired by Amazon in 2018. The central product is its video doorbell, which allows Ring users to see, talk to, and record those who come to their doorsteps. This is paired with a neighborhood watch app called \u201cNeighbors,\u201d which allows users to post instances of crime or safety issues in their community and comment with additional information, including photos and videos<\/p>\n<p>A series of reports reveals that Amazon had negotiated Ring video-sharing partnerships with more than 700 police departments across the US. Partnerships give police a direct portal through which to request videos from Ring users in the event of a nearby crime investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Not only is Amazon encouraging police departments to use and market Ring products by providing discounts, but it also coaches police on how to successfully request surveillance footage from Neighbors through their special portal. As Chris Gilliard, a professor who studies digital redlining and discriminatory practices, comments: \u201cAmazon is essentially coaching police on . . . how to do their jobs, and . . . how to promote Ring products.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The big concern here is that the entrenchment of these surveillance systems could become so deep that the law enforcement community would treat their extrication the same as if we were trying to disarm them.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why: In the US, cops are supposed to get a warrant to invade our privacy if they suspect criminal activity. But they don\u2019t need one to use Amazon\u2019s Neighbors app or <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2019\/07\/12\/we-gave-us-police-ice-and-cbp-ai-without-regulations-in-2016-now-its-1984\/\">Palantir\u2019s horrifying LEO app<\/a>.\u00a0 With these,\u00a0Police can essentially\u00a0perform digital stop-and-frisks on any person they come into contact with using AI-powered tools.<\/p>\n<p>AI Now warns that these problems \u2014 biased AI, discriminatory facial recognition systems, and AI-powered surveillance \u2014 cannot be solved by patching systems or tweaking algorithms. We can\u2019t \u201cversion 2.0\u201d our way out of this mess.<\/p>\n<p>In the US, we\u2019ll continue our descent into this Orwellian nightmare as long as we continue to vote for politicians that support the surveillance state, discriminatory black-box AI systems, and the Wild West atmosphere that big tech exists in today.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon and Palantir shouldn\u2019t have the ultimate decision over how much privacy we\u2019re entitled to.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to read the full 60-page report, it\u2019s available online <a href=\"https:\/\/ainowinstitute.org\/AI_Now_2019_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>",

I saw one particularly amusing comparison to a refrigerator. It works in vertical or horizontal orientation, and is designed to function quietly. Xbox head Phil Spencer told Gamespot the name of the console came in part because \u201c<span>it gives us freedom to do other things with that name so that we can create descriptors when we need to.\u201d So\u2026 could we possibly see a \u201cSeries Pro\u201d or a \u201cSeries Slim\u201d or something like that? I\u2019d be curious to see if that\u2019s what he means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to pack considerably more power in its CPU, especially compared to the relatively modest hardware of the One X. Microsoft <a href=\"https:\/\/news.xbox.com\/en-us\/2019\/12\/12\/microsoft-unveils-xbox-series-x\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">refers to it<\/a> as \u201c<span>our custom-designed processor leveraging the latest Zen 2 and next generation RDNA architecture from our partners at AMD.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/xbox-series-x-specs-twice-as-powerful-as-xbox-one-\/1100-6472198\/?utm_source=reddit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Gamespot later confirmed<\/a> the console\u2019s GPU will have twice the power of the Xbox One X\u2019s, and that the company has invested in\u00a0<span>NVMe solid-state drives. The company\u2019s not naming specific hardware, and the proof will be in the gameplay, but so far it\u2019s sounding like a monster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>That said, there\u2019s one major\u00a0hardware\u00a0development that\u00a0Xbox is content to shelve for now: Spencer said <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/11\/26\/xbox-project-scarlett-vr\/\">they weren\u2019t interested in\u00a0VR<\/a> at the moment because it\u2019s still a niche\u00a0product. Specifically, he said \u201cnobody\u2019s asking for\u00a0VR\u201d on\u00a0Xbox.<\/p>\n<p>We know of two games that\u2019ll be on the Series X:\u00a0<em>Halo Infinite<\/em>, first revealed E3, and\u00a0<em>Hellblade II: Senua\u2019s Saga<\/em>, revealed alongside the console at the Game Awards. They look pretty cool, but, again, we\u2019d have to see gameplay to really know what this console is capable of giving us.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft made it clear in the announcement that backwards compatibility was a thing, and we know it\u2019s aiming to make the console compatible with all previous-gen Xboxes. We also already know that Microsoft <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/11\/20\/microsoft-wants-xbox-scarlett-to-support-cross-gen-play-anywhere\/\">hopes to bring Xbox Play Anywhere<\/a> to Series X, which means that your purchased games, achievements, and saves could potentially transfer from your One to your new Xbox. That said, we\u2019ve yet to see exact details on how that\u2019ll work.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s still the chance we could have a second Xbox in the next-generation, as <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/12\/05\/microsoft-two-xbox-scarlett-cheaper\/\">the console codenamed Lockhart<\/a> is rumored to still be in development. This one is supposed to be a less powerful version of the Series X, with a less intimidating price tag to boot.<\/p>\n<p>Which brings me to the biggest thing we don\u2019t yet know about the Series X: the price. How much is the \u201cfastest, most powerful\u201d console going to set us back? Last time, Xbox was at a disadvantage, both because it revealed its price first, and because that price turned out to be $100 more than the PS4. I\u2019m hoping Sony and Microsoft won\u2019t end up in some kind of game of chicken, waiting for the other to announce their price first.<\/p>",

It\u2019s something that often comes up, and I\u2019ve heard it mentioned three times in the past week alone. The seemingly logical reasoning goes like this: \u201cDon\u2019t focus on gender \u2014 just hire the best people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At first, this seems very logical. You can hear a manager saying it, and he or she would probably mean well, that they don\u2019t want to discriminate against candidates or employees based on gender. There are, however, two big reasons why this logic is flawed.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, if you\u2019re not focusing on getting a more diverse audience to apply to your company\u2019s vacancies, you won\u2019t meet the best people for the job, just the ones that fit your profile. If you\u2019re not intentionally looking beyond the obvious choices, you\u2019re doomed to be stuck in the same pattern that plagues most tech companies who keep hiring employees who look the same, because they keep looking in the same places. And the two are not mutually exclusive \u2014 there are plenty of highly skilled people of different backgrounds that you\u2019re likely missing because you\u2019re not seeking them out. That\u2019s part one.<\/p>\n<p>The second part is more important: people don\u2019t exist and work in a vacuum, and every person you hire adds to your company\u2019s collective experience. The goal, of course, is to hire great people who together make up great teams, which make up a great company, which then creates great products or services. The best person for the job is the person who\u2019s best for the whole company, and when they come with a background and experience that the rest of your employees don\u2019t have, that will only strengthen the team\u2019s collective experience.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you may disagree, but you can see how some of the biggest companies in the world don\u2019t understand this and fail, by making a bad product or facing a PR disaster. One such example is Apple. Apple Health launched alongside the Apple Watch back in 2014. Apple\u2019s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi at the time said that the health metric-tracking app would let users \u201cmonitor all of your metrics that you\u2019re most interested in.\u201d But you know what the app didn\u2019t have? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2014\/12\/how-self-tracking-apps-exclude-women\/383673\/?utm_source=TNW&amp;utm_campaign=fe94fc3060-weekly_boris_2017_01_11_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_32f70ba9aa-fe94fc3060-13246657&amp;mc_cid=fe94fc3060&amp;mc_eid=7fd072208d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">A period tracker<\/a>. I think it\u2019s safe to assume that if Apple Health\u2019s product team had a balance of people who actually get periods, a menstruation tracker would have been added.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you might think, who cares? The app can do so much more, like measure steps, blood alcohol content, and respiratory rate! But there\u2019s a business case for diversity, beyond it being something that will make your company better, more interesting, and a leader for change: what Apple did in that moment was create an opportunity for another company to see their mistake, and create a period tracking app. Women make up approximately half of the world\u2019s population \u2014 that\u2019s around 3.9 billion people. Do you really want to potentially give up 3.9 billion potential customers to your competition?<\/p>\n<p>I use biological sex and gender here as examples, but this extends to race, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, and more. A person that adds diversity to your team makes the company better, so that\u2019s the best person to hire.<\/p>\n<p>More diversity in a company will make you solve problems better, and build better products. It will prevent you from making mistakes. It will add fresh and much needed opinions and perspectives. It will make you more efficient and more successful. The best person for the job is undeniably the person that has the right skills, but also one that adds qualities and perspectives to your company that weren\u2019t previously represented. You\u2019re not doing yourself a favor if you think that skills are the only thing that matters \u2014 a non-diverse hire is a missed opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><em>Can\u2019t get enough of Boris?

The price? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Canon-M50-Mirrorless-Digital-Advanced\/dp\/B07VGM9FDR\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Just $599<\/a> \u2014 that\u2019s $300 off the original price of $899 for just the camera and the lens, without any of the accessories. Pretty good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The EOS M50 sports a\u00a0<span>24.1-megapixel APS-C sensor that handles both still images and video excellently. It\u2019s also got a fully articulating touchscreen LCD screen, in case you need to get some tricky shots or you\u2019ve got vlogging ambitions (or perhaps both).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what else you\u2019ll get:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A camera bag for your new photography kit<\/li>\n<li><span>SanDisk 64GB C10 Ultra UHS-I SDXC memory card<\/span><\/li>\n<li>A mini tripod with a pistol grip<\/li>\n<li>A cleaning kit for your camera<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In other words, the kit comes with pretty much everything you\u2019ll ever need to kickstart your photography journey.<\/p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t tried the EOS M50 myself, but our managing editor Abhimanyu Ghoshal owns one \u2013 and absolutely adores it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<span>I love the M50 not just because it\u2019s small, easy to use, and an excellent performer, but also because it supports Canon\u2018s extensive range of EF and EF-S lenses with an optional adaptor (even cheaper third-party ones like this work fine, since there\u2019s no glass in it to worry about),\u201d he tells me.\u00a0<\/span><span>\u201cThat makes this an infinitely extensible camera, which is great for beginners and intermediate-level photographers who enjoy experimenting with various lenses and setups.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Does that sound like the right fit for your needs? Great, then grab the Canon EOS M50 photography kit for just $599 by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Canon-M50-Mirrorless-Digital-Advanced\/dp\/B07VGM9FDR\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">clicking here<\/a>.

That\u2019s a minor 0.36 percent increase in 24 hours, or $26. It was the highest closing price in one day.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re still 63 percent below Bitcoin\u2018s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin market cap<\/h2>\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s market cap ended the day at $131,087,151,088.

Your photos and videos lose a ton of details and quality when you share them on the social network \u2013 a result of compression to make this content load faster on web and mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>The company is finally changing that.

There are plenty of caveats to the preservation of the quality including the size and resolution of the photo. Here\u2019s the full list of conditions for an image to retain its original quality on\u00a0Twitter for the web:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The resolution shouldn\u2019t be more than 4096 pixels on any side. So, images with 16-megapixel (4096 x 4096) resolution should be fine.<\/li>\n<li>The size of the image shouldn\u2019t be more than 5MB \u2013 so\u00a0<span>most photos shot with today\u2019s smartphones<\/span> can fit within this size.<\/li>\n<li><span>The orientation shouldn\u2019t be set to rotate the image.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This development won\u2019t be too beneficial if you\u2019re trying to show off your photography skills by u<span>ploading full-size high-res images from your DSLR<\/span>. But it\u2019s still useful for folks who mostly use their phones to capture the world around them.<\/p>\n<p>O\u2019Brien also said this feature will be rolling out to pictures for your avatars next year. Time to snap some pretty profile pictures.<\/p>",

Zuckerberg first mentioned this ambition in March when he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/mark-zuckerberg\/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking\/10156700570096634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">outlined his vision<\/a> for the future:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[Today] if you want to message people on Facebook you have to use Messenger, on Instagram you have to use Direct, and on WhatsApp you have to use WhatsApp. We want to give people a choice so they can reach their friends across these networks from whichever app they prefer. We plan to start by making it possible for you to send messages to your contacts using any of our services, and then to extend that interoperability to SMS too.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The reason this seems so extra-thorny is that Facebook is currently the subject of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/07\/24\/technology\/facebook-ftc-antitrust-investigation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">an FTC investigation<\/a> \u2014 specifically, an antitrust inquiry. Facebook\u2019s facing similar inquiries from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2019\/10\/22\/forty-six-attorneys-general-have-joined-new-york-led-antitrust-investigation-into-facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">47 states\u2019 attorneys general<\/a>, and that\u2019s not even mentioning that it was hit with <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/facebook\/2019\/07\/24\/facebook-gets-away-with-5b-ftc-fine-for-leaking-your-data\/\">a $5 billion fine<\/a> from the FTC just before this. I can\u2019t say I sympathize, really, but the company is taking a bit of a battering.<br>\nIt\u2019s not a huge surprise the FTC is taking this step. Chairman Joseph Simon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/64e887f6-c2b8-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">told the Financial Times in August<\/a> that this integration specifically would muck up any possibility of breaking up the company should the FTC find its practices anticompetitive: \u201c<span>If they\u2019re maintaining separate business structures and infrastructure, it\u2019s much easier to have a divestiture in that circumstance than in where they\u2019re completely enmeshed and all the eggs are scrambled.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Should the FTC move to break the company up, it would mean undoing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. During a House subcommittee in July, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/07\/25\/technology\/chris-hughes-facebook-breakup.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">an antitrust academic said<\/a>, \u201c<span>Facebook can\u2019t name its competitors because they bought them,\u201d meaning before they had the clout to really challenge Facebook\u2019s model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary on how true it is that Facebook lacks real competition. I would say part of its insidiousness comes not from buying the competition, but from emulating it. Not to bring up an old bugbear of mine, but <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apps\/2017\/04\/14\/instagram-snaps-snapchats-hold-millennials\/\">just ask Snapchat<\/a>.<\/p>",

If the enemy team gets hip to what I\u2019m doing, or they also have multiple \u201crun-and-gun\u201d players, I slow things down and start playing more methodically.

At the time, Microsoft had emphasized the design was comprised of five primary components: light, depth, motion, material, and scale.

Individual layers can be manipulated for animation, while different materials reflect, absorb, and transmit light in different ways.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vcBGj4R7Fo0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear those Fluent components are live in the icons.

It\u2019s not as bad as was feared.\u00a0You don\u2019t\u00a0<em>have\u00a0<\/em>to log into Facebook just to use the Oculus platform. Facebook hasn\u2019t gone that far\u2026 yet (and hopefully it never will). But Facebook\u2019s still chipping away at the wall separating the metaphorical church and state.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and speculate that this some sort of prep work for Horizon, <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/facebook\/2019\/09\/25\/ready-player-what-facebook-announces-a-new-vr-social-network\/\">Facebook\u2019s\u00a0<em>Ready Player One<\/em>-ish shared virtual space<\/a>. Facebook would probably want Oculus and regular Facebook users to have the same kinds of experiences in Horizon, so this might be it folding the two together before Horizon launches some time next year.<\/p>",

I\u2019m not the first one to notice this, but it\u2019s still happening, and it\u2019s more prevalent than we realize. While I personally identify as a cisgender female, I still care about this issue because it affects many good people, including the ones I care about.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8c57\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Max Masure<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo gp hy hz ia ib\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/gender-inclusivit\/why-i-put-pronouns-on-my-email-signature-and-linkedin-profile-and-you-should-too-d3dc942c8743\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">wrote a great article<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>on why cisgender people should be normalizing pronoun usage that I would recommend for other cisgender people to help educate themselves. In this article, they mention how cisgender people can normalize gender diversity by including pronouns in their email, LinkedIn, website, etc. I think designers can take it a step further by adding more gender inclusion to the products we work on. Gender inclusion in our products is a small action that can have considerable impact. As designers, we advocate for the people we are serving, and so many of us say we are empathetic. Shouldn\u2019t a cisgender designer\u2019s empathy also extend to gender identity?<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<figure class=\"hb hc hd he hf hg eq er paragraph-image\"><div class=\"iz ja bl jb ak\">\n<div class=\"eq er iy\">\n<div class=\"hh r bl jf\">\n<div class=\"jg r\"><img class=\"oj qm cr t u hj ak jk lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Illustration with character filling out profile and selecting \u201cnon-binary\u201d as gender option\" width=\"1361\" height=\"911\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1225\/1*rO3XZpc2fxs7Hb3iJ9figA.png\" data-lazy=\"true\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><h2 id=\"fc37\" class=\"ig ih fg ar aq de ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is\">How to design beyond binary<\/h2>\n<p id=\"0158\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The most common places that users identify their gender is in an onboarding experience or their user profile. In many cases, this is the first impression that someone gets from your product. It\u2019s essential that it\u2019s minimal and, yes, inclusive. Users can, and will, leave an onboarding experience if they determine they don\u2019t like it or aren\u2019t comfortable with the questions asked.<\/p>\n<p id=\"b401\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Similarly, people will delete their accounts with products if those products can\u2019t meet their needs. Gender inclusivity is especially relevant for companies that specialize in social media, health, finance, insurance, etc. Anywhere where gender data is gathered by an organization, you have an opportunity to do better. So let\u2019s talk about how to be gender inclusive in your design processes.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t ask for gender unless you need to<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p id=\"2c60\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In any onboarding experience or any experience in which you request information from people, you should be asking yourself, \u201cIs this question necessary?\u201d We\u2019ve all experienced the horrors of filling out lengthy forms. Forms are often considered an annoying experience, so much so that autofill is a thing. The same logic applies to asking for gender information. Honestly, while researching apps I have on my phone, I found a lot of them keep my gender information. In many instances, it makes sense. Each experience is different, and I know that gender plays a big part in marketing campaigns, but if you don\u2019t<span>\u00a0<\/span><em class=\"if\">really<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/em>need gender information, try not to ask.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"hb hc hd he hf hg eq er paragraph-image\"><div class=\"eq er jx\">\n<div class=\"hh r bl jf\">\n<div class=\"jy r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oj qm cr t u hj ak jk lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Screenshot from Pandora music application with module that says \u201cWhy does Pandora need my gender?\u201d\" width=\"291\" height=\"492\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/262\/1*b8NaoVVVpY55L2uKlu6YHQ.png\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F12%2Fwhy-designers-need-to-look-beyond-2-genders%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Sources:\u00a0Apptimize,\u00a0Pandora\" data-title=\"Share Sources:\u00a0Apptimize,\u00a0Pandora on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Sources:\u00a0Apptimize,\u00a0Pandora on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Sources:\u00a0Apptimize,\u00a0Pandora<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><h2 id=\"ad0f\" class=\"jl ih fg ar aq de jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If your gender field is necessary, let people understand why<\/h2>\n<p id=\"6caa\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One emerging trend in onboarding experiences is explanatory text associated with form fields.

You can Google \u201chow many genders are there\u201d and get a myriad of answers. There is so much more to gender and sexuality than a simple form can contain, so this is why I recommend allowing for multiple gender options, or even a custom gender selection. Facebook is one product that currently allows users to do both. They also allow people to change their gender at any time in their profile settings. These features are Facebook\u2019s way of embracing a world that is not binary, allowing people to change and transition as they discover their gender identity. These are especially valuable when presented in the context of social media so that people can be socially seen in the same way they identify.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"hb hc hd he hf hg eq er paragraph-image\"><div class=\"iz ja bl jb ak\">\n<div class=\"eq er kg\">\n<div class=\"hh r bl jf\">\n<div class=\"kh r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oj qm cr t u hj ak jk lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Facebook\u2019s gender selection screenshot\" width=\"1148\" height=\"400\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1033\/1*Kr36-McrWCjBzxR3HIL_4Q.png\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F12%2Fwhy-designers-need-to-look-beyond-2-genders%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Source:\u00a0Facebook\" data-title=\"Share Source:\u00a0Facebook on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Source:\u00a0Facebook on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Source:\u00a0Facebook<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><figure class=\"hb hc hd he hf hg eq er paragraph-image\"><div class=\"iz ja bl jb ak\">\n<div class=\"eq er ki\">\n<div class=\"hh r bl jf\">\n<div class=\"kj r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oj qm cr t u hj ak jk lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Facebook\u2019s pronoun selection screenshot\" width=\"1222\" height=\"546\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1100\/1*qnpkDrJ5GzyKoz33smRAew.png\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F12%2Fwhy-designers-need-to-look-beyond-2-genders%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Source:\u00a0Facebook\" data-title=\"Share Source:\u00a0Facebook on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Source:\u00a0Facebook on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Source:\u00a0Facebook<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><h2 id=\"133c\" class=\"jl ih fg ar aq de jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"bu\">Let people pick their pronouns<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p id=\"4e0a\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In the same breath, allowing people to select their pronouns is also essential.

How many articles do we have to read that speaks to all people in the same way? Representation matters, so let\u2019s try to represent everyone. As someone who has had to find stock images for the past ten years of my life, I know that options can be limited and that better options tend to cost more. I know that data related to transgender individuals aren\u2019t as common as we would like. Try your best, and advocate for better representation in the products you are working on. Culture shifts take time.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"ba8f\" class=\"ig ih fg ar aq de ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is\">The business advantage<\/h2>\n<p id=\"9751\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Inclusive design always has a moral value. But if you\u2019re someone who cares about inclusivity and wants to build inclusive work, you\u2019re going to have to get good at answering \u201cwhat\u2019s the business value?\u201d<\/p>\n<p id=\"c4ab\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You might be thinking, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we do what is right simply because it is right?\u201d As someone who has been dealing with this question since the day I stepped into my career, I want to tell you honestly that I have felt that way too. But making a business case for the work you do is key to becoming a leader, to making change happen. The good news is that making a business case for something you are passionate about is an excellent way to learn how to win over stakeholders. For me, going to bat for the issues that mean the most to me is an easy thing because I will give it my all, and in most cases, I can win them over. Systemic change is about every little thing we can do better, it can be hard, but it\u2019s worth it.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c257\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">On the other hand, if you\u2019re someone who is reading this article asking why you should bother with building work that isn\u2019t gender binary, you\u2019ve come this far, and I respect that!

In some cases, this could be true, and it could be more problematic if your business is serving conservative clients. But we should never forget that our world is ever-changing. Millennials and Gen Z are coming into ages in which they have buying and voting power. If your product, especially an aging product, does not build support among younger generations, it is at a much higher risk of eroding. Additionally, products like Facebook have included gender diversity in their designs, and I do not see conservatives out there trying to ban it. Maybe they simply haven\u2019t noticed it? Regardless, I suspect that gender-inclusive design will do more good than harm, especially in the long run.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"hb hc hd he hf hg eq er paragraph-image\"><div class=\"iz ja bl jb ak\">\n<div class=\"eq er ku\">\n<div class=\"hh r bl jf\">\n<div class=\"kv r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oj qm cr t u hj ak jk lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ellevest\u2019s onboarding experience\" width=\"785\" height=\"530\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/706\/1*Q7Up-a_H7SqbiWCJ9Zsq5Q.png\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F12%2Fwhy-designers-need-to-look-beyond-2-genders%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Source:\u00a0Ellevest\" data-title=\"Share Source:\u00a0Ellevest on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Source:\u00a0Ellevest on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Source:\u00a0Ellevest<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><h2 id=\"550c\" class=\"jl ih fg ar aq de jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Competitive advantage<\/h2>\n<p id=\"9685\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you\u2019re in a newer organization or serving younger audiences, inclusive design can be one of the most advantageous moves you can make. Let\u2019s take the example of<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo gp hy hz ia ib\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ellevest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ellevest\u2019s<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>onboarding experience. In this, users can select from the options of male, female, and non-binary. For a business that is disrupting the financial industry, Ellevest is using gender inclusion to their advantage. Financial industries notoriously suffer from outdated and hyper rigid values. Ellevest has sought to go against those old financial industry practices and mirrors their values in the design. Doing this helps Ellevest stand apart even further from the industry it seeks to disrupt. This design also captures a new, younger, and specialized set of audiences, which is invaluable to startups.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"0d7c\" class=\"jl ih fg ar aq de jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Better audience segmentation<\/h2>\n<p id=\"f087\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Audience segmentation is essential and the better we can do it, the more likely we are to gain sales and leads. Imagine what it would be like if we were able to serve a completely \u201cnew\u201d subset of users from male and female and specialize in their needs. I can guarantee that people who are transgender aren\u2019t going to have the same health needs or financial needs as a cisgender individual. As the number of people who identify as transgender increases, I anticipate we will need to segment their audience needs better.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"0b6a\" class=\"jl ih fg ar aq de jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Getting ahead of the big data curve<\/h2>\n<p id=\"6dc4\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of the issues we currently are facing in all products is a lack of data representing people who are transgender. As I mentioned, I anticipate that this will change quite quickly in the coming years and is already changing now. Getting ahead of this trend could be a massive win for any organization. There are businesses out there already doing this, but the time to invest in this segment of big data is now.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"5a3e\" class=\"jl ih fg ar aq de jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Attract Diverse Candidates<\/h2>\n<p id=\"f0c0\" class=\"hk hl fg ar hm b hn it hp iu hr iv ht iw hv ix hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Businesses should know diverse teams with inclusive cultures are more profitable.

It\u2019s not been too long since they were released and, with Christmas just around the corner, you might be considering picking one up for yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Thing is, unless you spend a lot of time reading about Apple\u2018s devices (like sad, little loser me), it can be confusing to work out what separates them all. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>We\u2019ve already put together videos on <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/10\/28\/video-difference-iphone-11-pro-iphone-11-pro-max-apple\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the differences between the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max<\/a>, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/10\/16\/video-what-new-with-the-iphone-11-xr-specs-overview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what\u2019s new with the iPhone 11,<\/a> but today we have another addition: what\u2019s new with the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max?<\/p>\n<p>Basically, this video (which you can watch above) breaks down everything that\u2019s fresh about the two Pro models, specifically comparing them to the devices they succeeded: the iPhone Xs and the iPhone Xs Max.<\/p>\n<p>For all that information, you can scroll up a little bit and use those gorgeous peepers to watch our glorious moving pictures. But what\u2019s that? You\u2019d like to read instead? Well, friend, we have that for you too. So, without further ado, here\u2019s everything that\u2019s new with the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max:<\/p>\n<h2>The cameras<\/h2>\n<p>As I\u2019ve said, the easiest way to say what\u2019s new with the\u00a0iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max is to compare them to their predecessors: the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max.<\/p>\n<p>Now, probably the biggest change has been the introduction of an extra lens, specifically a telephoto one (<a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/08\/25\/what-hell-telephoto-lens-phone-picture-photography\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more info on that here<\/a>).

While the pixel density and resolution has remained the same as the Xs and Xs Max (meaning the detail looks the same), the technology behind it has changed.<\/p>\n<p>For the user, this means you get a brighter display that uses less battery. In other words, a win-win.<\/p>\n<p>Another screen-related thing that\u2019s changed is Apple\u2018s removal of 3D Touch. Instead, the company has replaced it with Haptic Touch. This means you can still half-pressure on things to bring up options, but it\u2019s not quite as responsive as 3D Touch. In the grand scheme of things though, it\u2019s pretty minor, and not something you\u2019ll really worry about it when you\u2019re using the phone.<\/p>\n<h2>The battery<\/h2>\n<p>This is one of the best improvements over the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. Specifically, it\u2019s estimated that the iPhone 11 Pro gets an extra four hours of use over the Xs, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max pumps out five more hours than Xs Max.<\/p>\n<p>And, in my tests, I\u2019ve found this to be accurate. Using the iPhone 11 Pro Max, I regularly get two full days of use out of the thing, it\u2019s completely changed how I use my phone.<\/p>\n<h2>The inclusion of a fast charger<\/h2>\n<p>This is one of the best new parts of iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max \u2014 there\u2019s an 18W fast charger included with the phones, something that wasn\u2019t there with the last generation.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this important? Because now I can plug my iPhone in for around 30 minutes and receive 50 percent charge in that time. It\u2019s fucking awesome.<\/p>\n<h2>Want more info on the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max?<\/h2>\n<p>Then I\u2019d like to point you towards <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/11\/27\/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-human\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our in-depth review of the phone<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, there you have it!

The SEC has just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2019-259\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">charged<\/a> the head of a crypto startup for allegedly cheating investors out millions of dollars by lying about non-existent partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>The SEC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/litigation\/complaints\/2019\/comp-pr2019-259.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">complaint<\/a> claims that between August 2017 and April 2018, UnitedData founder Eran Eyal fraudulently sold unregistered securities via an ICO for \u201cShopin Tokens.\u201d<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"AXGgFnXj\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Capital raised by selling Shopin Tokens was supposed to be used to create shopper profiles that track purchase histories across online retailers, which were purportedly to be maintained by a blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>According to the SEC, Shopin never created a functional platform, despite raising $42 million. Authorities allege that both Eyal and Shopin repeatedly misrepresented \u201cpartnerships\u201d with well-known retailers, as well as the supposed involvement of a prominent figure in the digital asset industry.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019ve also claimed Eyal misappropriated investor funds for his own needs\u00a0<span>\u2014<\/span> including at least half a million dollars that he allegedly used for rent, entertainment, shopping, and even a dating service.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[T]he SEC seeks to hold Eyal and Shopin responsible for scamming innocent investors with false claims about\u00a0relationships and contracts they had secured in support of a blockchain-based universal shopper profile,\u201d\u00a0said the head of the SEC\u2019s New York office.<\/p>\n<p>They added: \u201cRetail investors considering an investment in a digital asset that meets the definition of a security must be afforded the same truthful disclosures as in any traditional securities offering.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The SEC has charged Eyal and Shopin with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of US federal securities laws. If successful in its suit, an officer-and-director bar would be placed on Eyal, and he would also be restricted from participating in any future offering of digital asset securities.<\/p>\n<p>Permanent injunctions, disgorgement with interest (which means repaying investors), and civil penalties are also being sought. Investors who contributed funds to the Shopin ICO are advised to contact the SEC, presumably for potential refunds.<\/p>\n<p>With this action, there\u2019s no doubt plenty of goons who raised money by hyping similarly non-existent \u201cpartnerships\u201d getting very sweaty right about now. The SEC hasn\u2019t forgotten.<\/p>",

I\u2019m glad to say that they\u2019re wrong: We use all of it, just in different ways at different times.<\/p>\n<p>The myth seemed to be supported by statements in serious textbooks and scientific articles that \u201cthe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellmind.com\/how-many-neurons-are-in-the-brain-2794889\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">human brain is made of 100 billion neurons<\/a> and 10 times as many supporting glial cells.\u201d I wondered if those numbers were facts or guesses. Did anyone actually know that those were the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.vanderbilt.edu\/vanderbiltmagazine\/brainiac-with-her-innovative-brain-soup-suzana-herculano-houzel-is-changing-neuroscience-one-species-at-a-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">numbers of cells in the human brain<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>No, <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/cne.24040\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">they didn\u2019t<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Neuroscientists did have a rough idea. Some estimates suggested 10 to 20 billion neurons for the human cerebral cortex, others some 60 to 80 billion in another region called the cerebellum. With the rest of the brain known to be fairly sparse in comparison, the number of neurons in the whole human brain was definitely closer to 100 billion than to just 10 billion (far too little) or 1 trillion (way too many).<\/p>\n<p>But there we were, neuroscientists armed with fancy tools to modify genes and light up parts of the brain, still in the dark about what different brains were made of and how the human brain compared to others.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303755\/original\/file-20191126-112526-hy3her.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"238\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303755\/original\/file-20191126-112526-hy3her.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303755\/original\/file-20191126-112526-hy3her.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=238&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303755\/original\/file-20191126-112526-hy3her.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=238&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303755\/original\/file-20191126-112526-hy3her.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=238&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303755\/original\/file-20191126-112526-hy3her.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=299&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303755\/original\/file-20191126-112526-hy3her.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=299&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303755\/original\/file-20191126-112526-hy3her.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=299&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><\/a><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F12%2Fneurons-a-fuckton-of-them-are-what-make-us-smarter-than-other-animals%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Slicing up different animals\u2019 brains \u2013 like this one from an elephant \u2013 is the first step.

A brain can be large but made of relatively few neurons if those neurons are huge, like in an elephant; primate neurons are small, and bird neurons are even tinier, so even the <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1517131113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">smallest bird brains can hide lots of neurons<\/a>. But never as many as the largest primate brain: ours.<\/p>\n<p>When comparing brains, we care about numbers of neurons in the cortex because it\u2019s the area of the brain that lets us go beyond the simple detection and response to stimuli, allowing us to learn from the past and make plans for the future.<\/p>\n<p>Because neurons are the Lego pieces that build brains and process information, the <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cobeha.2017.02.004\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">more cortical neurons a species has<\/a>, the more flexible and complex that species\u2019 cognition can be, regardless of size. And not just that: I recently found that the more cortical neurons, the <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/cne.24564\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">longer the species takes to develop into adulthood<\/a>, just like it takes longer to assemble a truckload of Legos into a mansion than a handful into a little house. And for as yet unknown reasons, <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/cne.24564\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">along with more cortical neurons comes longer life<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Getting more cortical neurons thus seems to be a two-for-one bargain: buy <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/bs.pbr.2019.06.001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">more mental capabilities, and along comes more lifetime<\/a> to learn to use them.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303766\/original\/file-20191126-112517-1fwokgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303766\/original\/file-20191126-112517-1fwokgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303766\/original\/file-20191126-112517-1fwokgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=433&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303766\/original\/file-20191126-112517-1fwokgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=433&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303766\/original\/file-20191126-112517-1fwokgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=433&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303766\/original\/file-20191126-112517-1fwokgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=544&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303766\/original\/file-20191126-112517-1fwokgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=544&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303766\/original\/file-20191126-112517-1fwokgy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=544&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><\/a><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F12%2Fneurons-a-fuckton-of-them-are-what-make-us-smarter-than-other-animals%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: No more rough estimates.

And the more cortical neurons they had, the longer kids remained kids, the longer their parents lived, and the more the former could learn from the latter, then from grandparents, and even great-grandparents. Cultures soon flourished. Technology bloomed and lived on through schooling and science, becoming ever more complex.<\/p>\n<p>With so much culture to share, what makes us modern humans has become about <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/bs.pbr.2019.06.001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">much more than our human biology<\/a>. Being born with lots of neurons gives us the potential for a long and slow life, one where each of our brains gets a chance to be educated by what the generations before us have learned, and to educate the next ones. We will remain modern humans so long as we are willing to convene around dinner tables to celebrate our differences and to share our hard-earned knowledge, stories of success and failure, our hopes and dreams.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article is republished from <a href=\"http:\/\/theconversation.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Conversation<\/a>\u00a0by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/profiles\/suzana-herculano-houzel-891152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Suzana Herculano-Houzel<\/a>, Associate Professor of Psychology, <a href=\"http:\/\/theconversation.com\/institutions\/vanderbilt-university-1293\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Vanderbilt University<\/a>\u00a0under a Creative Commons license.

The former employee, meanwhile, claims the company\u2019s main evidence was obtained by monitoring his texts.<\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit, which Apple filed in a California court, alleges that Gerard Williams III breached an intellectual property agreement that prohibited him from doing anything to compete with the company. Williams, formerly the top architect of Apple\u2018s mobile chips, started Nuvia in February, which manufactures chips for data centers.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>It sounds like a dry case, but the juicy picture the two parties are painting makes me want to grab some popcorn and watch. Nuvia\u2019s two other leaders, Manu Gulati and John Bruno, are also Apple alumni. In addition to coaxing employees to leave Apple while still under its employ, <a href=\"https:\/\/regmedia.co.uk\/2019\/12\/10\/apple_v_gerard_williams.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Apple also claims<\/a> that Williams based Nuvia\u2019s chips on work he\u2019d done for the Cupertino company:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span>This case involves a worst-case scenario for an innovative company like Apple: A trusted senior director with years of experience, and years of access to Apple\u2019s most valuable information, secretly starts a competing company leveraging the very technology the director was working on, and the same teams he was working with, while still employed by Apple.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Williams\u2019 little legal turnabout, in this case, is that Apple illegally collected text messages sent between him and Nuvia\u2019s co-founders while building their case. In his countersuit, <a href=\"https:\/\/regmedia.co.uk\/2019\/12\/09\/applevwilliamscounter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">his legal team writes<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span>To further intimidate any current Apple employee who might dare consider leaving Apple, Apple\u2019s complaint shows that it is monitoring and examining its employees\u2019 phone records and text messages, in a stunning and disquieting invasion of privacy.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One part of the complaint from Apple \u2014 which has apparently flirted with the idea of designing servers \u2014 is that Williams used his insider\u00a0knowledge of the company\u2019s intentions. He built Nuvia specifically to be something Apple would need \u2014 which he does say in one of the obtained text messages.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not Apple obtained these messages directly from Williams\u2019 phone or some kind of backup they had stored, I would not be the slightest bit surprised if the company was monitoring its employees. Leaks are still a thing that happens, after all.<\/p>\n<p>The part that might sink Apple\u2019s lawsuit isn\u2019t necessarily the text messages. The company claims that Williams breached duty of loyalty by working on his startup before leaving Apple. California has a ban on non-compete clauses in contracts, so a judge might take a dim view of a company attempting to enforce what amounts to the same thing.<\/p>",

S\u00f8rensen is perhaps best known for his work on another Netflix original, the critically acclaimed Quicksand.<\/p>\n<p>After launching in 2006, the Sweden-based company wasn\u2019t exactly a smash hit. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or even TikTok, more recently, Spotify was a bit of an unknown for nearly half a decade after opening its doors. The company launched its first app in 2008, offering free streaming music (or commercial-free subscriptions) for $10 a pop. But the company didn\u2019t extend its reach outside of Europe until 2011, the year it officially launched in the United States. Seven years later, in 2018, it IPO\u2019d with a $26.5 billion valuation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe founding tale of Spotify is a great example of how a local story can have a global impact,\u201d adds Tesha Crawford, Netflix\u2019s Director of International Originals (Northern Europe).<\/p>",

It\u2019s become a near-ubiquitous staple of FPS games since <em>Player Unknown\u2019s Battlegrounds<\/em> brought it to the mainstream and <em>Fortnite<\/em> made it a world-wide phenomenon. Until now, the closest thing racing fans have had to this kind of action is <em>Rocket League<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t have a lot of information to go on as of yet, but the blueprint for The Eliminator \u2013 as Playground Games is calling it \u2013 was already there in the form of global game events that saw players rushing to complete objectives and enter zones before time ran out.<\/p>\n<p>The new mode appears to expand on those timed community events with more structure and a new drama system that features an ever-closing circle of death which forces drivers to stay inside the racing zone. Per the above video, players can follow on-screen and GPS indicators to race along a predetermined path, or risk going off course to find shortcuts and avoid aggressive players.<\/p>\n<p>We know The Eliminator will feature up to 72-players and it looks like gameplay will span the base map, which covers Great Britain. Whether it\u2019ll be available on DLC maps such as the Lego update remains to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>In other update-related news for the upcoming series 17, Toyota will make its long awaited return to the <em>Forza<\/em> franchise with the in-game unveiling of the 1998 Supra RZ. This should signify the release of more Toyota vehicles after the new series begins tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Forza Horizon has always been the arcade-esque answer to <em>Forza Motor Sports<\/em>\u2018 more serious racing simulation \u2013 though both feature the same excellent variety of vehicles and tight gameplay. Battle Royale might seem a bit silly for a racer, but the open-world, always online nature of <em>Horizon<\/em> makes it feel like a natural fit.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be diving in with the rest of you when the patch goes live tomorrow, see you at the finish line! You can play <em>Forza Horizon 4<\/em> as part of Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/xbox-game-pass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Xbox Game Pass<\/a> subscription gaming service.<\/p>",

Well, comparatively reasonable.

The limited, unclassified information available makes it appear as though the project stops just short of functioning as an AI weapons system capable of firing on self-designated targets as they become available in the battle space.<\/p>\n<p>Google previously held the contract but, allegedly due to employee push back, the Mountain View company chose not to renew when it expired in March. At least a dozen employees <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2018\/05\/15\/google-employees-quit-over-the-companys-military-ai-project\/\">walked out<\/a> in 2018 after Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene announced the company <em>would<\/em> renew the contract. Subsequent internal pressure lead to Google ultimately declining to bid for the contract again.<\/p>\n<p>The Pentagon didn\u2019t have to look very far to find a company willing to pick up where Google\u2018s ethics left off. Palantir, the company that powers\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2019\/08\/12\/study-trumps-paid-peter-thiels-palantir-1-5b-so-far-to-build-ices-mass-surveillance-network\/\">ICE and CBP\u2019s surveillance networks<\/a> and builds software for police that circumvents the warrant process, is reportedly chugging away on Project Maven.<\/p>\n<p>Business Insider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/palantir-took-over-from-google-on-project-maven-2019-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">broke the news<\/a> today, reporter Becky Peterson writes that a person familiar with the project said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Palantir is working with the Defense Department to build artificial intelligence that can analyze video feeds from aerial drones \u2026 Internally at Palantir, where names of clients are kept close to the vest, the project is referred to as \u201cTron,\u201d after the 1982 Steven Lisberger film.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Previously, Peter Thiel, the founder of Palantir and long time Donald Trump associate, had referred to Google\u2018s withdrawal from the project as tantamount to treason. In June of 2018, speaking at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, Thiel referenced Google\u2018s decision to push forward with Project Dragonfly (a controversial Google program to build Search out for China) while abandoning the Pentagon\u2019s Project Maven. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/rachelsandler\/2019\/07\/15\/peter-thiel-says-cia-should-investigate-google-for-being-treasonous\/#c70243e521d0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">He said<\/a>\u00a0the CIA should investigate Google:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Is it because they consider themselves to be so thoroughly infiltrated that they have engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military\u2026 because they are making the sort of bad, short-term rationalistic [decision] that if the technology doesn\u2019t go out the front door, it gets stolen out the backdoor anyway?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Google was allegedly working with the Chinese government,\u00a0not necessarily the Chinese\u00a0military (which would have no reason to develop a censored search engine with Google).<\/p>\n<p>Thiel\u2019s supposition, <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2019\/09\/18\/peter-thiels-palantir-set-to-delay-ipo-under-bumbling-leadership-of-ceo-alex-karp\/\">one echoed by<\/a> Palantir\u2019s CEO Alex Karp, is that it\u2019s big tech\u2019s patriotic duty to do whatever the US government tells it. Of course, Thiel <a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/small-biz\/startups\/newsbuzz\/peter-thiel-missed-out-on-china-now-hes-betting-on-patriotism\/articleshow\/70493761.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">hasn\u2019t always felt this way<\/a>. He\u2019s invested in Chinese startups, bid for contracts, and worked with Chinese agencies before.<\/p>\n<p>However, what Thiel fails to mention, time and time again when he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/08\/12\/technology\/the-phony-patriots-of-silicon-valley.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">spouts his patriotism rhetoric<\/a>, is that the US government doesn\u2019t have an official policy on the ethical use of AI nor any publicly available guidance on how the military is authorized to use AI.<\/p>\n<p>We stand on the cusp of AI-powered warfare and there\u2019s no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/topics\/world-war-ii\/geneva-convention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Geneva Convention<\/a> for keeping countries like Russia, the US, and China from deploying legions of autonomous killing machines designed to seek and destroy civilian populations. While, as Thiel often puts it, it is important to maintain an edge on our nation\u2019s potential enemies, it\u2019s also important to ensure we\u2019re acting with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.armscontrol.org\/factsheets\/cwcglance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the bare minimum of ethics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of technologies we don\u2019t use for warfare because they\u2019re unethical. We don\u2019t use mustard gas or white phosphorous anymore, for example, because they\u2019re inhumane. Autonomous killing machines should fall into the same category. And, though the Pentagon claims Project Maven is just about taking pictures, any developer can tell you that training a drone to <em>shoot<\/em> something works about the same whether it\u2019s carrying a camera or a weapon. There\u2019s probably <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2018\/05\/30\/why-is-the-us-military-spending-millions-on-googles-open-source-ai\/\">more to Project Maven<\/a> than meets the eye.<\/p>\n<p>Until the US government and its allies come up with firm regulations for the military use of AI, it seems unethical for anyone to build dual-use AI for it.<\/p>",

While Chaudhary is a relatively recent leaker, he does have several accurate releases under his belt.<\/p>\n<p>The leaker claims the P40 \u2013 it\u2019s not clear if he\u2019s talking about the P40 Pro or plain P40 \u2013 will come with some serious-business specifications. Among these is a 6.5-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, something we\u2019ve previously only seen on a couple of gaming devices.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">(2\/3)Huawei P40 will innovatively apply graphene materials to the positive and negative electrodes and electrolytes of mobile phone batteries.

Moreover, the battery will be able to fully charge in 45 minutes thanks to 50W charging capability.<\/p>\n<p>Other purported specs include dual front cameras (one of them ultrawide) and five cameras on the rear.

In the company\u2018s own words:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span>\u2026beginning on December 7, 2019, WhatsApp will take legal action against those we determine are engaged in or assisting others in abuse that violates our Terms of Service, such as automated or bulk messaging, or non-personal use, even if that determination is based on information solely available to us off our platform. For example, off-platform information includes public claims from companies about their ability to use WhatsApp in ways that violate our Terms. This serves as notice that we will take legal action against companies for which we only have off-platform evidence of abuse if that abuse continues beyond December 7, 2019, or if those companies are linked to on-platform evidence of abuse before that date.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In other words, people or services flaunting their ability to advertise via WhatsApp or whom otherwise abuse bulk messaging may find themselves facing WhatsApp\u2018s lawyers. It\u2019s not hard to find such services with a quick Google search, so hopefully, this change will lead to at least a little less spam on the platform.<\/p>",

And given that YouTube was raked over the coals for its inability to curb on-platform harassment, it\u2019s probably no surprise it\u2019s updating its harassment policy.<\/p>\n<p>Matt Halprin, YouTube\u2018s Global Head of Trust and Safety, said the new policy will\u00a0\u201c\u2026not only prohibit explicit threats, but also veiled or implied threats. This includes content simulating violence toward an individual or language suggesting physical violence may occur.\u201d He also added, \u201cWe will no longer allow content that maliciously insults someone based on protected attributes such as their race, gender expression, or sexual orientation. This applies to everyone, from private individuals, to YouTube creators, to public officials.\u201d<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>You\u2019d have thought that wouldn\u2019t need to be added, but here we are.<\/p>\n<p>Halprin specifically mentions an incident \u201cearlier this year\u201d that led to them re-examining their policy. The incident in question is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/recode\/2019\/6\/10\/18660364\/vox-youtube-code-conference-susan-wojcicki-carlos-maza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">alleged harassment of Vox journalist Carlos Maza<\/a>, which <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TeamYouTube\/status\/1136055805545857024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">YouTube dismissed<\/a> as merely a difference\u00a0of opinion: \u201c<span>Opinions can be deeply offensive, but if they don\u2019t violate our policies, they\u2019ll remain on our site.\u201d<\/span> It later demonetized the YouTuber offering the opinion, but, as Maza points out, that did virtually nothing to stop him.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, the response to this wasn\u2019t pretty. It was exacerbated by the fact that Maza was in part targeted because of his sexuality, and he pointed it out during Pride Month, in which YouTube was doing a big, splashy promotion for its LGBTQ+ creators and how it was helping them. Within days, YouTube <a href=\"https:\/\/youtube.googleblog.com\/2019\/06\/taking-harder-look-at-harassment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">issued a statement<\/a> saying it would reexamine its harassment and hate speech policies, \u201c<span>in consultation with experts, creators, journalists and those who have, themselves, been victims of harassment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We traveled across the country with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/raymondbraun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">@RaymondBraun<\/a> to explore what Pride means to LGBTQ+ people 50 years after Stonewall.

If a content creator is found to \u201c<span>brush up against our harassment policy\u201d too often, they can be removed from the partner program, have their vids taken down, or their entire channel removed in some cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is something that\u2019s going to take a lot of work to enforce \u2014 by the very nature of veiled threats, they\u2019re hard to quantify.\u00a0YouTube\u2018s also going to have to walk a very fine line lest it do too much or too little. Neal Mohan, chief product officer, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/12\/11\/technology\/youtube-harassment-policy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">told the New York Times<\/a>, \u201c<span>There\u2019s a lot of nuance and context that\u2019s important here, but it is really something we want to get right on our platform. We don\u2019t want this to be a place where individuals are harassed. We want to take a clear line about that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It feels as though\u00a0YouTube\u2018s 2019 has been one long clean-up operation. It\u2019s had to recon with extremist content and the lack of protection for children, in addition to its toxicity problem.<\/p>",

It also features a pop-up selfie camera, meaning you have an uninterrupted screen for all your browsing.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-featured_img wp-image-1261530 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Honor 9X\" width=\"796\" height=\"597\" sizes=\"(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-796x597.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-796x597.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-280x210.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-360x270.jpg 360w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-180x135.jpg 180w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-1592x1194.jpg 1592w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-368x276.jpg 368w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-736x552.jpg 736w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-1376x1032.jpg 1376w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-1044x783.jpg 1044w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-632x474.jpg 632w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-536x402.jpg 536w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/IMG_0793-1200x900.jpg 1200w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fplugged%2F2019%2F12%2F11%2Fbudget-phones-fucking-good-honor-9x%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Here\u2019s the Honor 9X on my incredibly unclean balcony rail, but don\u2019t look at that.

details.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The shots the Honor 9X produces are solid, but don\u2019t quite have the refinement or detail of high-end phones. In my experience, it\u2019s more great for those day-to-day snaps and, for the price, is pretty impressive.<\/p>\n<p>The phone does have to cut corners at points though. The Honor 9X isn\u2019t super fast, and the screen isn\u2019t as sharp or slick as flagships. The OS has a very Huawei feel to it and, in my eyes, is a bit clumsy. It\u2019s totally usable, but it\u2019s not something I would describe as slick.<\/p>\n<p>While the build quality is solid \u2014 it definitely doesn\u2019t\u00a0<em>feel<\/em> like a budget phone \u2014 it\u2019s not gonna last you forever. But why would you expect it to?<\/p>\n<p>Overly harsh criticism feels unfair though. Do I want the best phone on the market for the least amount of money? Of course I do. But that\u2019s impossible. Some compromises will have to be made in the name of affordability.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the Honor 9X has taught me a valuable lesson: budget phones are actually good now. I shouldn\u2019t let the trauma of an awful experience dissuade me from giving cheaper handsets a go.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019m going to start buying cheap phones (because I\u2019m a snobbish nerd), but that doesn\u2019t mean devices like the Honor 9X don\u2019t have a solid niche. If I was looking for first phone for a child, or a cheap number for a clumsy relative, the Honor 9X would be a strong contender. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anrdoezrs.net\/links\/8824894\/type\/dlg\/https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?psb=1&amp;tbm=shop&amp;q=honor%209x&amp;ved=0CAIQs4sDKABqFwoTCOyL4rHZnuYCFSUOswAdYxwFzxAb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">You can pick one up here if it tickles your fancy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Is it perfect? No, of course fucking not. But anything that gets me to reconsider my relationship with budget phones can\u2019t be that bad.

        "content": "<p>Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since it was in its blooming stages in the 1940s. It was a time when the direct interaction between AI and humans seemed impossible and people were even scared by the thought. All sorts of theories started emerging that made artificial intelligence look deadly for humans. The idea of robots or droids were thought of as something that could hurt the human population and even drive them to extinction. In spite of all theories, researchers were able to predict one thing for sure. Artificial intelligence will be able to transform lives and the way humans interact with one another. It will reshape the societies and industries that we know today.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to 2019, an era where artificial intelligence is vividly present all around us. In other words, we are living in the age of AI. Take a look around you. Be it the smart assistant on our mobile phones, websites, e-commerce platforms, search engine results, home automation appliances, classrooms, and more. Every single element is trying to adopt AI and cause an impact for the good. This is in turn radically transforms\u00a0societies and pushes\u00a0people to develop emotional bonding with their gadgets and AI devices. Today, when we want to find directions to a place, we do not stop by strangers and ask them. Instead, we turn on Google maps and let technology guide us.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<h2>The healthcare sector with AI<\/h2>\n<p>One of the biggest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been its implementation in the healthcare sector. One of the most fundamental industries in the world, the healthcare sector is far behind in today\u2019s world. Even though technological marvels are constantly fascinating in the world, there is a significant amount of work that needs to be done in the healthcare sector. From diagnosis to medicine and providing healthcare facilities in rural areas, artificial intelligence has a lot of scope for health care support.<\/p>\n<p>However, there has been some significant progress in the healthcare industry. All thanks to artificial intelligence that was powered by the wave of digitization. As more and more organizations are turning digital, it\u2019s providing an abundance of data for machines to work upon them. Now we have robots that are successfully performing surgery on patients, software programs that are better diagnosing diseases far better than traditional pathological practices, and wearable devices that can monitor our health and send updates about alarming situations in real-time.<\/p>\n<h2>Disease care and longevity<\/h2>\n<p>Still, there\u2019s an emerging need for transformation in the field of medicine. We still have drugs that address the concern of a mass population, only to leave a few with side effects. Similarly, diseases like cancer do not have any permanent remedy or targeted course of medication that treats the patient well without leaving them with any side effects. Similarly, people over the age of 50 are one of the fastest-growing demographic groups around the world. It\u2019s creating a lot of challenges for the global economy and the healthcare sector. These people need to be provided with efficient care and medical support that is targeted towards the longevity of their lives.<\/p>\n<p>The Longevity Industry that provides healthcare support to the population above 50 is turning into a multi-trillion dollar industry, with close to 260 companies in the UK alone. Any progress in the longevity distribution at scale will have a huge impact and multiplicative effects on economies and societies around the world. After all, it would be a huge loss if the experienced population who have been responsible for more than a few innovations in the world are facing sudden deterioration in health in a way that reduces their quality of life. Not only will it be a huge loss to the economies but also result in increased dependency on the healthcare system. Having said this, artificial intelligence has a lot of potentials to manifest in this field and come up with solutions that target the emerging needs of the population accurately.<\/p>\n<p>Research indicates that increasing the lifespan of humans even by one year will decrease the suffering of tens of millions of people and improve the quality of life for billions of others. One such effort in this direction is personalized medicine that targets the individual needs of humans with precision. So, let\u2019s say that if a person has asthma, precision medicine will only focus and target the cells that are responsible for asthma and help in regenerating them. This would leave other portions or tissues of the human body untouched and treat only what was needed. Therefore, in place of treating generalized symptoms, AI can help shift medicine towards prevention, personalization and ultimately precision.<\/p>\n<p>With the advent of digitization in the healthcare sector, more and more patent records are going digital. This practice is helping researchers and medical experts understand the history of a patient in detail with the past treatments and health support they\u2019ve received. The vast amount of data collected from thousands of such medical records can be studied and used by AI to understand how a particular treatment can impact a particular gene inside the human. Moreover, digitization is also enabling researchers from all walks of life to work together, thus, laying an excellent foundation for biotechnology and computer experts to work together towards personalized medicine.<\/p>\n<p>For example, CRISPR is a gene-editing technology that is being used to target the DNA sequences precisely. With this, medical experts can deliberately activate or inhibit certain genes in human beings. This demonstrates that there is a strong ability to target an individual\u2019s distinctive molecular and genetic profile, thus opening up new opportunities for personalized medicine.<br>\nThe National Institute of Health describes precision medicine as an emerging approach for the treatment of diseases and their prevention, which takes a person\u2019s gene variability, environment and lifestyle into account. It requires the assistance of deep learning algorithms that can learn from the data at an unprecedented rate and combine the knowledge of medical experts to reach a decision.<\/p>\n<p>However, precision medicine will not be the end of human touch. It will still require vast expertise of medical experts to analyze the results obtained from machines and understand its real-world implications for the patient. With wearable devices, electronic health records and information about the geographic and demographic history of the patient, deep learning algorithms in AI have a lot of potential to device personalized medicine for people that target precision issues with high accuracy.<\/p>\n<p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">This article was originally published on Towards Data Science by\u00a0<span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/@james_52456?source=post_page-----bf436df6d9da----------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">James Warner<\/a><\/span>, a b<span>usiness intelligence analyst with knowledge on Hadoop\/Big data analysis at NexSoftSys.com\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>",

As an example, the toaster\u2019s counterpart, a smart fridge, was compromised to send thousands of spam emails\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.proofpoint.com\/us\/threat-insight\/post\/Your-Fridge-is-Full-of-SPAM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>without the knowledge of its owners<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Security firm Proofpoint, which caught the errant spamming fridge, found a botnet attack that has the ability to take over devices remotely and send emails. The attack reached 100,000 devices spanning routers, multimedia centers, TVs and that one particular model of fridge.<\/p>\n<p>So, what can we do to protect our IoT devices from this type of attack?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The First Step Is to Diagnose\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The US Federal Bureau of Investigation released a public service announcement in 2018 which warned of the dangers of \u2018cyber actors\u2019 using IoT devices as proxies for anonymity and the pursuit of malicious cyber activities.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the techniques the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ic3.gov\/media\/2018\/180802.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>FBI listed<\/span><\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>for judging whether an IoT device is compromised are to check for spikes in internet usage (a larger than usual internet bill, for example, maybe a symptom), devices that become slow or inoperable, unusual outgoing Domain Name Service (DNS) and outgoing service or home or business internet connections slowing down.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span>\u201cThe modernization of critical infrastructure is an area that needs focus to ensure security controls are integrated to mitigate the risk of disruption\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Binary District Journal spoke with<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/raj-samani-3697b9\/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>Raj Samani<\/span><\/a>, Chief Scientist at security solutions company McAfee. \u201cThe modernization of critical infrastructure is an area that needs focus to ensure security controls are integrated to mitigate the risk of disruption,\u201d he tells us.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have seen the impact when this is not the case, often resulting in the loss of essential services, such as power, to citizens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>The Raging Concerns About IoT<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>With the IoT growing around us, the concern is real and not just a product of paranoia. We spoke with<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tatsuya-mori-2a925817\/?originalSubdomain=jp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>Tatsuya Mori<\/span><\/a>, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. He confirmed one area of risk as the IoT develops.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most worrying threat to the current IoT is the existence of IoT devices with insufficient security measures,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, many IoT devices such as webcams or IoT toys have been shipped with the weak password configuration. An attacker can easily take over the device by logging into the device from a remote site.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also told us that there are as many as hundreds of devices worldwide that are infected with malware and controlled by adversaries. These devices can be used to conduct further attacks in the form of denial of service.<\/p>\n<p>Tatsuya also expressed his concerns about the use of the cloud, as many AI devices rely on it for the core of their \u2018intelligent services.\u2019 Once the cloud is compromised an attacker can steal sensitive data.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Firmware Is the Soft Spot<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Firmware \u2013 the permanent software that is embedded into IoT devices \u2013 is the Achilles heel of the IoT universe. While software that runs computers and mobile devices is regularly updated by the companies behind them, IoT devices do not always receive the same love from manufacturers. In fact, some of these devices may not even be updatable at all.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Mori revealed that IoT devices that have been discontinued may not be able to receive updates at all. Since many users are not technologically proficient, the ideal situation would be one in which the device comes with an auto-update feature.<\/p>\n<p>Mori also feels that it is vital that users are informed about the End of Life (EOL) of their products, a significant step in them becoming more knowledgeable about the potential risks to the device in the future.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it could be argued that it is crucial that the IoT industry establishes some sort of universal standards when it comes to updates. This would allow for the rollout of updates irrespective of the device\u2019s manufacturer.<\/p>\n<p>It would also free consumers from having to update their devices themselves, as the process could be widely automated. The update process would work almost as it does in the case of mobiles and laptops, wherein the device connects to an update server, downloads the relevant update, authenticates it and then proceed to install it, largely by itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Security Concerns Have Become Obstacles in Development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Security concerns surrounding IoT devices are so strong that they have become an impediment to the development of IoT as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>We asked<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/garethdavies78\/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>Gareth Davies<\/span><\/a>, Director of Public Relations at the GSM Association, his thoughts on the impact on development.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday we see that the majority of IoT services do not make it past the \u2018proof of concept\u2019 stage because of security concerns \u2013 with organizations not prepared to take the liability for services that may be insecure and could lead to brand damage and fines (though GDPR rules, etc),\u201d he tells us.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span>\u201cToday we see that the majority of IoT services do not make it past the \u2018proof of concept\u2019 stage because of security concerns\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere are also many examples of IoT services that have been commercialized that have major security issues \u2013 you only have to look at all the press stories which appear on almost a daily basis. So today security is a major barrier to the commercialization of IoT services.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another big issue is that of privacy. IoT devices pose a number of privacy-related issues such as user identification, user tracking, profiling, and utility monitoring and controlling. Since a lot of IoT devices are designed in a particular way, for example, to be in \u2018sleep mode\u2019 while not being used, the efforts to secure them are more complicated.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to privacy, Samani says, \u201cI would suggest the most important element is establishing a level of understanding from consumers on the privacy implications of buying connected devices for the home. For example, digital assistants are excellent technology, but it is imperative that consumers are aware of their \u2018always on\u2019 nature.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Industry Leaders on IoT Security Risk Mitigation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While all risks related to IoT may not be eliminated, there are things that we can do to ensure that we do not end up becoming victims of our own technological innovations. This means developing a security mindset.<\/p>\n<p>It is essential to recognize that connecting previously unconnected devices to a network does have its own hazards, knowing that new kinds of devices may bring new vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe reason security is a barrier to market adoption of IoT services is down to a mix of lack of expertise, lack of scalable solutions and lack of <span style=\"background-color: rgba(46, 146, 255, 0.2);\">cost-effective<\/span>\u00a0solutions that fit with the lean commercial models associated with many IoT services,\u201d Davies says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo address these points the GSMA promotes a harmonized industry approach to address IoT security issues via the use of the common recommendations contained within our very comprehensive set of<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsma.com\/iot\/iot-security\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>IoT security guidelines<\/span><\/a>. We also promote the use of \u2018self-assessment\u2019 using our IoT\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsma.com\/iot\/iot-security-assessment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>security assessment<\/span><\/a>.

They also have the McAfee Security Home Platform, which is focused on home networks and can automatically secure connected devices through a router.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IoT Security is Being Addressed\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>IoT devices are unique in the sense that they are ordinary daily objects and so their need for effective security measures might not be immediately obvious, but steps are being taken to minimize risk.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Mori revealed that efforts are already underway in Japan to address the concerns regarding the security of IoT devices as the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) in cooperation with internet service providers have launched an initiative called NOTICE or National Operation Towards IoT Clean Environment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis initiative aims to investigate IoT devices that could be used for cyber attacks and alert users of those devices,\u201d he tells us. \u201cOn the basis of their survey, we may be able to take effective actions toward mitigating various threats.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is just as well because as we make strides towards the connected era, we are also taking the first steps towards ensuring our toasters don\u2019t end up spying on us.<\/p>\n<p><em>This post was written by Margarita Khartanovich for<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/journal.binarydistrict.com\/can-we-stop-our-toasters-from-spying-on-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Binary District,<\/a>\u00a0an international \u0441ollaborative technology community that creates unique competency-based workshops and events on new technologies.

However, the chat app has stood firm and said it\u2019ll have to break encryption to trace messages and <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/security\/2019\/06\/18\/india-is-still-hounding-whatsapp-to-make-its-messages-traceable\/\">the company\u2019s not ready to risk user privacy to achieve that<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the key points of the new version of the data bill:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>India will form a\u00a0Data Protection Authority (DPA) to oversee the implementation and regulation of the bill<\/li>\n<li>India can exempt any government agency from the purview of the bill \u201cin the interest of\u00a0<span>sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order.\u201d<\/span>\n<\/li>\n<li>A company can get a fine of Rs. 15 crores ($2.1 million) or four percent of its global revenue for processing children\u2019s data unlawfully.<\/li>\n<li>For failing to report a data breach or violations found in data audits, the fine is Rs. 2 crores ($283,000) or two percent of global revenue.<\/li>\n<li>The center can form and change any policy around non-personal data such as anonymized search results or shopping data. It can ask any company or entity to submit non-personal or anonymized data.<\/li>\n<li>Social media entities \u201cwhose actions have, or are likely to have a significant impact on electoral democracy, the security of the State, public order or the sovereignty and integrity of India\u201d will be considered significant data fiduciaries. They\u2019ll have to inform authorities if they\u2019re undertaking large scale profiling of sensitive data such as sexual orientation or biometrics.<\/li>\n<li>These entities will also have to provide a means for users in India to\u00a0<span>voluntarily verify themselves and show a mark of verification next to their profiles.\u00a0<\/span>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Currently, there are quite a few questions and concerns regarding the bill. The primary concern is that the government can exempt any agency. That may give the said agency unlimited and uninterrupted access to data of citizens whether it needs it or not.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Under the proposed data protection bill, government can grant exemptions to certain companies to collect any personal data.

Rossi Lorathio Adams II was just sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to force a man to transfer him the doitforstate.com domain.<\/p>\n<p>Adams, a 27 year-old from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ran a small social media empire dubbed \u2018State Snaps.\u2019 It spanned millions of followers across Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter and depicted \u201c<span>images and videos of young adults engaged in crude behavior, drunkenness, and nudity,\u201d according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-ndia\/pr\/social-media-influencer-sentenced-14-years-federal-prison-after-plotting-hijack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">press release<\/a> from the US Department of Justice. <\/span><\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p><span>Adams was a student at Iowa State University when he founded State Snaps in 2015, and his<\/span>\u00a0followers often used the phrase \u201cDo it for State\u201d \u2013 presumably a play on \u201cdo it for the Vine\u201d \u2013 hence his interest in the domain name.<\/p>\n<p>Adams began pressuring the domain owner to give up the domain in June of 2015, and continued to do so for the next two years. The owner did not want to sell initially. He later offered to sell for $20,000, but Adams didn\u2019t want to pay up. Then in June of 2017, Adams enlisted his cousin, Sherman Hopkins Jr, to break into the owner\u2019s home and force him to give up the domain.<\/p>\n<p>Hopkins entered the victim\u2019s home carrying a gun and taser, and wearing a pantyhose over his head, sunglasses and a hat. Per the DoJ release:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The victim was upstairs and heard Hopkins enter the home.\u00a0 From the top of a staircase, the victim saw Hopkins with the gun on the first floor.\u00a0 Hopkins shouted at the victim, who then ran into an upstairs bedroom and shut the door, leaning up against the door to stop Hopkins from entering.<\/p>\n<p>Hopkins went upstairs, kicked the door open, grabbed the victim by the arm and demanded to know where he kept his computer.\u00a0 When the victim told Hopkins that he kept his computer in his home office, Hopkins forcibly moved the victim to the office.\u00a0 Hopkins ordered the victim to turn on his computer and connect to the Internet.\u00a0 Hopkins pulled out Adams\u2019 demand note, which contained a series of directions on how to change an Internet domain name from the domain owner\u2019s GoDaddy account to one of Adams\u2019 GoDaddy accounts.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>At one point, Hopkins tased the victim in the left arm, back, and neck. Fearing for his life as Hopkins became increasingly violent, the victim tried to gain control of the gun. Though he was shot in the leg during the struggle, he eventually managed to wrestle the gun out of Hopkins\u2019 hands and shot him multiple times in the chest.<\/p>\n<p>Hopkins, who was living in a homeless shelter at the time of his attack, survived and pleaded guilty in 2017. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and apologized to the victim in court. Adams was sentenced earlier this week to 168 months imprisonment, and ordered to pay nearly $9,000 in restitution, in addition to $26,000 in legal fees.<\/p>\n<p>Should have just paid for the domain name, I guess.<\/p>\n<p><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2019\/12\/failed-plot-to-steal-domain-name-at-gunpoint-brings-14-year-prison-term\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ArsTechnica<\/a><\/em><\/p>",

Unlike traditional \u201cRC\u201d races, this doesn\u2019t involve a bunch of people staring up at the sky with a remote control in their hands. The drones in this sport fly at over 70 MPH and they\u2019re controlled in first-person perspective by pilots through the use of video goggles. As the league\u2019s website says, this is as close to Star Wars\u2019 Pod Racing as humans can get right now.<\/p>\n<p>The league created its Artificial Intelligence Robotic Racing (AIRR) circuit this year and, in partnership with Lockheed Martin, put up a million dollar purse to the team that won. The championship was held last Friday and MavLab\u2019s AI\u00a0dominated all the other AIs. Not only did the team walk away with the big prize, it also got the opportunity to test its robots mettle against some flesh.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lp1GfELnVRE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Professional drone pilot Gabriel Kocher, who goes by Gab707, took on that challenge and gave the AI-powered drone a walloping its developers won\u2019t soon forget.

It\u2019s a fairly compact unit given its claimed in-room bass extension of 33 Hz with a single 6.5-inch woofer. It comes in matte white, black, and wooden boxes that are tasteful without being showy, while circular grilles optionally protect the drivers. Some might even think the speakers a little plain next to comparably priced models from KEF or Bowers and Wilkins.<\/p>\n<p>Take a closer look though, and you\u2019ll notice careful consideration to acoustics that make the S400 different than your typical box speaker.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261172 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"1093\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-7-of-8.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-7-of-8.jpg 1640w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-7-of-8-280x187.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-7-of-8-405x270.jpg 405w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-7-of-8-203x135.jpg 203w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-7-of-8-796x531.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-7-of-8-1592x1061.jpg 1592w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Instead of the port(s) you\u2019d find on most other speakers \u2013 gaping orifices in the enclosure that help low bass hit with more authority \u2013 you\u2019ll see a more expensive passive radiator on the back. Passive radiators aren\u2019t <em>necessarily<\/em> better than a well-designed port, but they require less space for similar bass extension, allowing the S400 to maintain its svelte dimensions.<\/p>\n<p>Turning to the front, no, the speakers aren\u2019t upside down; the S400 is designed with the tweeter below the woofer and then tilted backward a tiny amount to ensure optimal time alignment between the drivers.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261175 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"2003\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-4-of-8.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-4-of-8.jpg 1640w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-4-of-8-172x210.jpg 172w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-4-of-8-221x270.jpg 221w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-4-of-8-111x135.jpg 111w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-4-of-8-796x972.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-4-of-8-1592x1944.jpg 1592w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>But the real star of the show is the massive waveguide \u2013 the conical structure surrounding the tweeter. More than an aesthetic flourish, Buchardt says its waveguide is a meticulously modeled component meant to precisely control the way its small 19mm tweeter radiates sound, helping the speaker both achieve a flat frequency response and radiate sound into a room in a highly controlled manner.<\/p>\n<p>All this preamble is to say that the Buchardt S400 doesn\u2019t need exotic materials, fancy new technologies, or other marketing gimmicks to sound really good.

It sounds as good at low listening levels as well as when blasting music.<\/p>\n<p>Their timbre is well-balanced, without emphasis in any particular region. Highs seemed balanced \u2018just right\u2019 \u2013 with ample detail without harshness or sibilance. That said, I did feel voices were a bit more recessed than I\u2019d like and I had to mess around with positioning to get voices just right. This is perhaps because I was coming off the mid-forward <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/wp-admin\/2019\/10\/21\/jbl-100-classic-review-an-iconic-70s-speaker-revived-as-a-modern-standout\/\">JBL L100 Classics<\/a> at the time, but I tend to prefer a little more emphasis in the mids on stereo speakers to help vocals shine through the \u2018phantom center.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Not that these were any slouches in the soundstage department overall. The Buchardts have a rather expansive soundstage with even more impressive imaging, presenting a sense of depth to the sound that made it easy to separate instruments during busy tracks. While I personally tend to gravitate towards an even more expansive soundstage, that tends to come at the expense of some precision. Those who prefer a more focused image will feel right at home with the Buchardt.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261177 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"2460\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-2-of-8.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-2-of-8.jpg 1640w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-2-of-8-140x210.jpg 140w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-2-of-8-180x270.jpg 180w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-2-of-8-90x135.jpg 90w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-2-of-8-796x1194.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Buchardt-S400-2-of-8-1592x2388.jpg 1592w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>My positive impressions were backed up by measured data.<\/p>\n<p>As usual, I performed measurements after forming most of my listening impressions. Measurements help eliminate biases and are highly correlated to user preferences. The wonderful, oh-so-rare thing this time around is that Buchardt actually provides a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buchardtaudio.com\/s400-detailed-description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">full suite of measurements<\/a> right on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buchardtaudio.com\/shop\/s400-white\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">S400\u2019s product page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t emphasize enough how refreshing that is. It shows the company has little to hide.<\/p>\n<p>Good measurements don\u2019t\u00a0<em>guarantee<\/em> you\u2019ll like a speaker, but they significantly increase the likelihood of it. Decades of research tells us that, contrary to some audiophile superstition, an overwhelming majority of listeners prefer speakers that measure reasonably \u2018flat\u2019\u00a0 when aimed at the listener, and whose sound radiates smoothly as you move off-axis. (The majority of what we hear in a typical living room setup is not the direct sound, but rather the reflections off of walls and other surfaces).<\/p>\n<p>First up, we have the horizontal response out to 75 degrees and an averaged \u2018listening window\u2019 response covering\u00a0a 30-degree horizontal and 10-degree vertical window. The latter accounts for the fact we don\u2019t sit perfectly still or centered, and is probably the most important individual curve.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261162 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"995\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Horizontal-Response.png\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Horizontal-Response.png 1200w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Horizontal-Response-253x210.png 253w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Horizontal-Response-326x270.png 326w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Horizontal-Response-163x135.png 163w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Horizontal-Response-796x660.png 796w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>This is a seriously admirable\u00a0performance for a speaker at any price point. Moreover, it\u2019s encouraging to see how closely my results line up with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.buchardtaudio.com\/s400-detailed-description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Buchardt\u2019s<\/a>, even though theirs were captured in a proper anechoic chamber and I use a 100-dollar jerry-rigged setup. Buchardt\u2019s measurements show slightly more treble energy and less of a dip around 16Khz, but they\u2019re very similar considering the different methodologies. It\u2019s nice to confirm the company isn\u2019t fudging its measurements.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, that massive waveguide is doing its job, leading to some of the flattest listening window and on-axis responses I\u2019ve measured until that dip at the top of the treble (frequencies many people can\u2019t hear anyway). The only speaker I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/esfZtxu.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">measured flatter<\/a> is the Neumann KH80, which uses digital signal processing to enhance the speaker\u2018s sound.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the off-axis response is remarkably smooth, suggesting an excellent soundstage and even tonal balance. It also means you have some flexibility for angling in the speakers. Point them straight forward for a more expansive soundstage, or point them straight out your for a more focused one. You also don\u2019t have to be seated perfectly in the center for neutral tonality.<\/p>\n<p>Bass response is also impressive for a small speaker, keeping in mind that the anechoic response doesn\u2019t show the major reinforcement a normal speaker would get from being close to your room\u2019s walls. It should suffice for most\u00a0acoustic music, and I found Buchardt\u2019s claim of an in-room response down to 33Hz to be realistic. You won\u2019t get the deepest sub-bass, but no compact passive speaker will get you that. A subwoofer is always a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>The S400\u2019s on-axis and horizontal response, at least, slightly outdoes the $2,000\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/06\/21\/kef-r3-review-exemplary-speakers-that-do-almost-everything-right\/\">KEF R3<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 its direct competitor\u00a0and one of my favorite speakers on the market. The S400\u2019s measurements are also vastly superior to the $4,000\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/07\/19\/the-bowers-wilkins-formation-duo-might-actually-justify-their-4000-price\/\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Formation Duo<\/a>\u00a0(although the Duo is a wireless speaker and has much better deeper bass thanks to DSP).\u00a0 Its measurements also look nicer than the $4,000\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/wp-admin\/2019\/10\/21\/jbl-100-classic-review-an-iconic-70s-speaker-revived-as-a-modern-standout\/\">JBL L100 Classic\u2019s<\/a>, although I found myself preferring that speaker\u2019s wider dispersion and more mid-forward sound, which can counter an <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=tJ0uDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT340&amp;lpg=PT340&amp;dq=toole+interaural+crosstalk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QIezqsZ9hh&amp;sig=ACfU3U3sCZrutIQ3uVqt9ONY4fdNyOVU0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjv6fDjgazmAhVpUt8KHW7-A6kQ6AEwA3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=toole%20interaural%20crosstalk&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">inherent midrange dip<\/a> in all stereo playback.<\/p>\n<p>Next is the S400\u2019s\u00a0vertical response out to 30 degrees. The vertical response is far less important than the horizontal for impressions of\u00a0sound quality and soundstage,\u00a0but it can still affect a speaker\u2018s tonal balance.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261169 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"992\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-30.png\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-30.png 1200w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-30-254x210.png 254w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-30-327x270.png 327w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-30-163x135.png 163w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-30-796x658.png 796w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Almost every speaker with vertically aligned drivers \u2013 that is to say, the vast majority of them \u2013 shows flaws in the vertical response. The S400 is no different. Only coaxial speakers like the KEF R3 or a few exotic designs have a pristine vertical response.<\/p>\n<p>That said, we can see the S400 is particularly finicky about your listening height. Even at just 5-15 degrees above or below the reference point (at the center of the speaker, right between the woofer and waveguide), the sound shows significant variations from the on-axis response.<\/p>\n<p>In other words,\u00a0you should take care to set up the speaker such that the reference point is at ear level \u2013 the cabinet\u2019s 2-degree tilt helps here \u2013 especially if you listen from up close. I also would be wary about using these for nearfield listening on a desk, where flaws in the vertical response will be more audible.<\/p>\n<p>But unlike many speakers, the S400 impresses in that the vertical response actually straightens out again as we move to more extreme angles.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261170 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1053\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-75.png\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-75.png 1200w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-75-239x210.png 239w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-75-308x270.png 308w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-75-154x135.png 154w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/S400-Vertical-0-to-75-796x698.png 796w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>That means theese\u00a0flaws\u00a0should not affect the perceived tonal balance dramatically a typical living room setup.

It\u2019s a fantastic little speaker with excellent\u00a0bass extension and impact for a compact unit, impressive dynamics, a crystal clear soundstage, and mostly neutral tonality. It looks nice, feels solidly built, and is smaller than many competing systems.<\/p>\n<p>For many audio enthusiasts, the S400 could be endgame material. You\u2019d have a hard time finding a better pair of passive bookshelf speakers at its price or well above.<\/p>\n<p><em>The S400 is available from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buchardtaudio.com\/shop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Buchardt\u2019s website<\/a> with free shipping worldwide and a 30-day return policy (you just pay \u20ac25 for return shipping). Within Europe, it\u2019s priced at\u00a0\u20ac2,000, which includes 25 percent VAT. Outside of Europe, you can get it for\u00a0\u20ac1,610, or approximately $1,800.

The team\u2019s breakthrough research resulted in the experimental creation of what they\u2019re dubbing a \u201cquantum FM radio\u201d to transmit data over long distances. This feels like an eureka moment for quantum computing.<\/p>\n<p>The team\u2019s work involves silicon carbide, a naturally occurring semiconductor used to make all sorts of electronics including light emitting diodes (LEDs) and circuit boards. It\u2019s also used in rocketry due to its ability to withstand high temperatures and in the production of sand paper \u2013 presumably because it\u2019s coarse. What we\u2019re excited about is its potential as a conduit for controlling quantum states.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Today\u2019s quantum computers \u2013 under the IBM\/Google\/MIT paradigm \u2013 are giant, unwieldy things that absolutely won\u2019t fit on your desktop. They require lasers and sub-zero temperatures to function. You need a team of physicists standing by in an expensive laboratory just to get started. But the University of Chicago team\u2019s work may change all that.<\/p>\n<p>They used good old fashioned electricity, something we\u2019re pretty good at controlling, to initiate and direct quantum states in silicon carbide. That means they didn\u2019t need fancy lasers, a super cold environment, or any of that mainframe-sized stuff to produce quantum results. This wasn\u2019t the result of a single experiment, but in fact involved two significant breakthroughs.<\/p>\n<p>The first, the ability to control quantum states in silicon carbide, has the potential to solve quantum computing\u2019s \u201cexotic materials\u201d problem. Silicon carbide is plentiful and relatively easy to work with compared to the standard-fair physicists use \u2013 which includes levitated atoms, laser-ready metals, and perfectly-flawed diamonds. This is cool, and could fundamentally change the direction most quantum computing research goes in 2020 and beyond. But it\u2019s the second breakthrough that might be the most exciting.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/news.uchicago.edu\/story\/surprise-breakthrough-scientists-create-quantum-states-everyday-electronics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a press release<\/a> from the University of Chicago, the team\u2019s method solves quantum computing\u2019s \u201cnoise\u201d problem. Per Chris Anderson, a co-author on the team\u2019s paper:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Impurities are common in all semiconductor devices, and at the quantum level, these impurities can scramble the quantum information by creating a noisy electrical environment. This is a near-universal problem for quantum technologies.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Co-author Alexandre Bourassa added:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In our experiments we need to use lasers, which unfortunately jostle the electrons around. It\u2019s like a game of musical chairs with electrons; when the light goes out everything stops, but in a different configuration. The problem is that this random configuration of electrons affects our quantum state. But we found that applying electric fields removes the electrons from the system and makes it much more stable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The work is still early, but it has incredible implications for the field of quantum computing. With a little tweaking, it appears that this silicon carbide-based method of wrangling quantum states could lead us to the \u201cunhackable\u201d quantum communications network sooner than many experts believed. According to the team, it would work with the existing fiber optic network that already transmits 90 percent of the world\u2019s data.<\/p>\n<p>On the outside, a \u201cquantum FM radio,\u201d that essentially sends data along frequency-modulated waves, could augment or replace existing wireless communication methods and bring about an entirely new class of technology. We\u2019re thinking something like Star Trek\u2019s TriCorders, a gadget that records environmental data, processes it instantly, and uses quantum AI to analyze and interpret the results.<\/p>\n<p>For more information read the Chicago team\u2019s research papers <a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/366\/6470\/1225\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/advances.sciencemag.org\/content\/5\/11\/eaay0527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>H\/t: <a href=\"https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2019-12-breakthrough-scientists-quantum-states-everyday.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Phys.Org<\/a><\/em><\/p>",

It\u2019s mostly cinematic first-person, but it shows a little bit of actual gameplay that implies it\u2019s going to be that\u00a0<em>RE4<\/em> over-the-shoulder third-person shooting. It follows Jill Valentine, who, <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/12\/03\/resident-evil-3-remake-cover-art-leak\/\">as I\u2019d hoped<\/a>, appears to have traded her tube top and skirt for a Lara Croft-ish blue tank top and actual pants.<\/p>\n<p>The trailer also shows a sneak preview of what it\u2019s going to be like to be stalked by this game\u2018s trademark monster, the hideous Nemesis. For the uninitiated: if you thought Mr. X was a goddamned nightmare, just wait until this seven-foot murder beast is literally\u00a0<em>sprinting\u00a0<\/em>after you with a bazooka on one of his arms. He\u2019s not explicitly shown doing this in the trailer, but here\u2019s a screenshot:<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-featured_img wp-image-1261153 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"796\" height=\"448\" sizes=\"(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Nemesis-796x448.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Nemesis-796x448.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Nemesis-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Nemesis-480x270.jpg 480w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Nemesis-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Nemesis.jpg 1024w\"><figcaption>Credit: Capcom<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>From what I can tell from the preview, the game will delve deeper into how Raccoon City went to shit so quickly and how the living population reacted. The town we saw in\u00a0<em>REmake 2\u00a0<\/em>was desolate, with only a few survivors scraping away at the remnants when Leon and Claire rolled up. Jill, meanwhile, is there when the streets are full of the undead, and the living are desperate to escape.<\/p>\n<p>I spotted a few differences already. Nemesis is on the hunt for S.T.A.R.S. members, the Raccoon City elite police squad who discovered the original Spencer mansion outbreak. Given Chris, Rebecca, and Barry got the hell out of dodge, the only S.T.A.R.S. members left are Jill and Brad Vickers, who fans will recognize from his signature yellow vest. He appears to be marginally less useless this time, helping Jill and giving her the lowdown on Nemesis.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-featured_img wp-image-1261157 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"796\" height=\"448\" sizes=\"(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Jill-796x448.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Jill-796x448.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Jill-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Jill-480x270.jpg 480w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Jill-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/RE3-Jill.jpg 1024w\"><figcaption>Credit: Capcom<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the major difference, though:\u00a0<em>REmake 3<\/em> will have a multiplayer game attached. That\u2019s right, it turns out that\u00a0<em>Project Resistance\u00a0<\/em>thing we heard about at the Tokyo Game Show is going to come in the same package, and is now called <em>Resident Evil Resistance<\/em>. This 4-v-1 mode will see a group of survivors try to outwit a single mastermind who\u2019s setting traps and controlling bioweapons in order to trap them.

It appears to be a bit better than that \u2014 though, from what I\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re missing a huge chance to borderline-remake\u00a0<em>RE: Outbreak<\/em> by including that game\u2018s characters as survivors. Also, having a <em>Resident Evil 3 Remake<\/em> as a single-player campaign has probably gained this game more goodwill in a single day than a six-month dedicated advertising campaign.<\/p>\n<p><em>Resident Evil 3<\/em> and\u00a0<em>Resistance\u00a0<\/em>will release on April 3, 2020.<\/p>",

Well, one company is trying to change that: North.<\/p>\n<p>The Canadian company (slowly) released its Focals, a pair of smart glasses, over the 11 months.

Because North has announced it\u2019s stopping the production of its Focals to concentrate on the next-generation of its smart glasses. Any guesses on the name? That\u2019s right!

The company claims that the Focals 2.0 will be 40 percent lighter (which makes sense) and have a \u201c10x improved retinal display\u201d (which makes a bit less sense).<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, North will still continue to offer a broad range of prescription support, meaning folks will be able to use the Focal 2.0 as their main, daily pair of glasses.<\/p>\n<p>The big question though is whether this\u2019ll be enough to save North from going under. When its first pair of Focals smart glasses were released, the company had to slash the device\u2019s price in order to make more sales.<\/p>\n<p>At a similar time, North also laid off 150 employees. And, throughout all this, the company has never revealed exactly how many of the first generation Focals it sold.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I could be wrong, but all this points towards a company on the edge, one that realizes it needs a big next product to survive. Only time will tell if North and its Focals 2.0 will be good enough to capture the public\u2019s attention and, indeed, if the public are actually ready to have their attention captured by a pair of smart glasses.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever happens, it\u2019s gonna be fun to watch. And, if the first renders are anything to go by, the Focals 2.0 will be interesting anyway.

Pretty nifty.<\/p>\n<p>The best part? You can attach as many emails as you\u2019d like. To do that, simply select the emails,\u00a0and drag and drop them. Alternatively, you can right click the selected emails and use the \u201cForward as an attachment\u201d option.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Here\u2019s how this works:<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1261075 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/992-GS-Attach-Email-to-Email-SM.gif\" data-lazy=\"true\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Email attachment should come in handy when you have to forward multiple messages related to the same topic. Usually, that\u2019d have to be done in separate emails, but the new implementation makes it possible to string forwards together.<\/p>\n<p>That should help you avoid clogging your inbox.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s one slightly unfortunate bit of news, though: Google has gone for a gradual release, so the feature won\u2019t be immediately available to all users. \u201c<span>You\u2019ll know this feature is available to you when you see the \u2018Forward as attachment\u2018 option in the three-dot More menu,\u201d Google says.<\/span> Keep an eye out.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in the early release group, lucky you; if not, hang in there, bud \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t take too long.

Let\u2019s hope the IQ3 has UCB-C.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>First off, there\u2019s the on-device dosage technology. According to the company, this will allow users to track their cannabinoid consumption per draw, then \u2014 once they\u2019ve reached a pre-set amount \u2014 the IQ2 will warn them. Normally this only works via the app (and who really regularly uses a vape app?), so this is a solid upgrade.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not all rosy. While this is a cool feature \u2014\u00a0especially if one of the reasons you prefer to vape is to regulate your intake \u2014 it\u2019s not useful for much of the world.<\/p>\n<p>For this dosage feature to work on the IQ2, you need to input the amount of marijuana in your oven (something that can be easily measured with a scale) and its potency, a potentially much harder ask. Maybe if you\u2019re in parts of the US or Canada that have a legal weed system, finding the exact THC levels of the bud is no problem, but this is much harder in places with a less\u2026 regulated weed market.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s a slightly hollow criticism, as just because it might not be useful for\u00a0<em>everyone<\/em>, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t useful. I think I might just be jealous of all those sweet dispensaries.<\/p>\n<h2>Any other cool features?<\/h2>\n<p>The other big change is found on the bottom of the DaVinci IQ2. Here, the company has introduced what it refers to as the Air Dial. Basically \u2014 and as the name makes clear \u2014 it\u2019s a dial on the bottom of the IQ2 that allows an adjustable amount of air into the weed vape.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Well, it can deliver a cooler and larger vapor cloud when smoking. Not bad, right?<\/p>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1261013 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"iq2 air dial\" width=\"549\" height=\"424\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/iq2-air-dial.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/iq2-air-dial.jpg 549w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/iq2-air-dial-272x210.jpg 272w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/iq2-air-dial-350x270.jpg 350w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/iq2-air-dial-175x135.jpg 175w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fplugged%2F2019%2F12%2F10%2Fdavinci-launch-iq2-update-weed-vape-vaporizer%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: You can spin that little wheel around to change the air flow into this lovely weed vaporizer.\" data-title=\"Share You can spin that little wheel around to change the air flow into this lovely weed vaporizer. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share You can spin that little wheel around to change the air flow into this lovely weed vaporizer. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>You can spin that little wheel around to change the air flow into this lovely weed vaporizer.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Aside from that, the IQ2 still has the same high quality components (including a glass-lined bowl and an all-ceramic vapor path) that made its predecessor such a wonderful weed vape.

This has created unexpected consequences during decryption.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a result, the decryptor provided by the Ryuk authors will truncate files, cutting off one too many bytes in the process of decrypting the file,\u201d Emsisoft said in a blog post. \u201cDepending on the exact file type, this may or may not cause major issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Researchers\u00a0said that in the best case scenario, the byte that was cut off is unused, therefore unnecessary, and could even be decrypted just fine.<\/p>\n<p>However, in virtual disk type files (such as VHD\/VHDX), as well as many database files (such as Oracle\u2019s), that last byte stores important information. It\u2019s common for larger, high-value target networks to feature these types of files.<\/p>\n<p>This means that those files will be damaged by Ryuk\u2018s decryption tool, and will fail to load properly even after they\u2019ve been unlocked by the tool provided by the attackers.<\/p>\n<h2>Being hit is still very costly, so make frequent backups<\/h2>\n<p>Ryuk has hit <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/hardfork\/2019\/10\/07\/us-hospitals-pay-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-to-survive-ryuk-ransomware-attack\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hospitals<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/security\/2019\/11\/12\/mexican-state-oil-firm-pemex-hit-by-ransomware-attack\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">state-owned oil refineries<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/hardfork\/2019\/11\/25\/bitcoin-ryuk-ransomware-cryptocurrency-blockchain-nursing-care-facilities-vcpi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nursing homes<\/a>, schools, private corporations, and <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/hardfork\/2019\/12\/09\/bitcoin-ransomware-government-data-argentina\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">government institutions<\/a> across the world over the past year, demanding hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in exchange for access to critical computer systems.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately for those who find themselves struck by Ryuk, there\u2019s currently no way to retrieve files without paying up. Previous analysis run on the malware shows that perps scale their Bitcoin ransoms dependant on the size of the target.<\/p>\n<p>As such, Emisoft advises Ryuk victims to make copies or backups of any data that\u2019s been encrypted, especially considering that the decryption tool provided by the attackers will reportedly delete files it thinks have been properly unlocked.<\/p>\n<p>That said, creating regular backups of data is advisable in any sense, as it will dampen the effect of being hit by ransomware in general.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that while Emsisoft has released many free decryption tools for other ransomware strains, the service it offers to Ryuk victims is a paid one.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA final word of advice: prior to running any\u00a0ransomware decryptor\u00a0\u2013 whether it was supplied by a bad actor or by a security company \u2013 be sure to back up the encrypted data first. Should the tool not work as expected, you\u2019ll be able to try again,\u201d said Emsisoft.<\/p>",

But their power is hard to account for. With volumes exceeding that of the Empire State Building, they move at high speeds of up to 360 kilometers per hour over flat surfaces for up to tens of kilometers.<\/p>\n<p>This seems to indicate that there is no or very little friction present. Friction is the fundamental physical force resisting the\u00a0motion of one surface sliding relative to another. The lack of friction in these long landslides \u2013 compared to normal, shorter ones \u2013 is comparable to suddenly losing traction when driving a car on a wet or icy surface: you pull the breaks, but you stop well beyond where you intended.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>To explain this conundrum, scientists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0032063311001589?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">have suggested<\/a> that these landslides must have taken place at a time when the area was covered in ice.

NASA<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p><\/figure><p>This is the reason why we study long, runout landslides on other planets in our solar system. There are in fact a number of advantages of doing so. On the red planet, landslides and their morphological features are well preserved for millions of years because of the reduced erosion rate and absence of vegetation and plate tectonics.<\/p>\n<p>We now also have available satellite images of the surface of Mars with a resolution that is better than what we have for some regions here on Earth. As a result, we can conduct observations and measurements that are not so granted on our planet.<\/p>\n<h2>New findings<\/h2>\n<p>Valles Marineris on Mars is a 4,000km <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/from-silicon-valley-to-valles-marineris-is-humanity-ready-for-elon-musks-mars-vision-66244\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">long, straight canyon<\/a>, as deep as 8km. It is situated just south of the Martian equator, where extraordinary examples of long, runout landslides are present. In our study, we focused on one of the best-preserved landslides \u2013 with a size similar to the entire State of Rhode Island in the US.<\/p>\n<p>The landslide shows long ridges that extend in the direction of the movement for almost the entire length of the deposit. As mentioned, these ridges have previously been interpreted to be a result of underlying ice at the time of the landslide. This hypothesis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/a-The-Sherman-landslides-fallen-in-Alaska-in-1964-Courtesy-USGS-b-La-Perouse_fig3_320926736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">is supported by the fact<\/a> that similar structures have been observed on terrestrial landslides on glaciers.<\/p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JUbQM47QXwQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" width=\"440\" height=\"260\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/figure><p>Based on this similarity, the presence of the ridges on martian landslides has been used in support of the theory that Mars <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/5\/26\/11772702\/mars-ice-age-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">was once covered in ice<\/a>. But the presence of glaciers and their timing at such martian latitude <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0019103517308333\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">is hotly debated<\/a>. What\u2019s more, it is still unclear which exact mechanisms created these ridges during the ice age.<\/p>\n<p>To investigate whether there may be other explanations, we made computer models of the landslide called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_elevation_model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\u201cdigital elevation\u201d models<\/a>. These are 3D representations of terrain, obtained from high-resolution satellite images and the terrain\u2019s elevation data. From this data, we could calculate the thickness of the landslides, the length of the ridges, their height and their wavelength \u2013 that is the distance from crest to crest between two ridges next to each other.<\/p>\n<p>We showed that the wavelength of the ridges is constantly two to three times the value of the thickness of the landslide. This relationship has previously <a href=\"https:\/\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\/hal-01432240\/file\/PRLpeigne01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">only been demonstrated in laboratory experiments<\/a> \u2013 which do not involve ice \u2013 and our result is the first field evidence.<\/p>\n<p>This suggests that ice is not a necessary condition for the formation of the long ridges. Instead, we propose that the ridges could have formed at high speeds due to underlying layers of unstable, light rocks. These layers would have been created by vibrations and collisions of rock particles at the bottom of the slide with the rough surface of the valley. This would have initiated a \u201cconvection process\u201d \u2013 transfer of heat by movement \u2013 that caused upper denser and heavier layers of rock to fall and lighter rocks to rise.<\/p>\n<p>Once we had accounted for this mechanical instability \u2013 and coupled it with the movement at phenomenal high speed of the slide \u2013 we could show that vortices extending in the direction of the landslide\u2019s movement were generated, giving rise to the long ridges that we observe on the surface of the landslide.<\/p>\n<p>The findings are important. On Earth, the incomplete record of such catastrophic events can lead to misinterpretations and overlooking of the hazard of these landslides. But, as they happened in the past, they will happen in the future, posing a great risk to infrastructures and people\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n<p>Turning our look further away to understand what is near us is sometimes a fundamental change of perspective. But, as we know landslides are also still happening on Mars, these studies will set the background knowledge for risk mitigation of human settlements on Mars, no matter how far in the future they are still.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

As Nikola Tesla used to say: Your heart must go on!<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"AXGgFnXj\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<h2>Bitcoin Price<\/h2>\n<p>We closed the day, December 09 2019, at a price of $7,400. That\u2019s a notable 2.12 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$160.90. It was the lowest closing price in four days.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re still 63 percent below Bitcoin\u2018s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin market cap<\/h2>\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s market cap ended the day at $133,904,005,787. It now commands 67 percent of the total crypto market.<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin volume<\/h2>\n<p>Yesterday\u2019s volume of $17,872,021,272 was the highest in two days, 8 percent above the year\u2019s average, and 60 percent below the year\u2019s high.\u00a0That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 380 tons of gold.<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin transactions<\/h2>\n<p>A total of 313,481 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 4 percent below the year\u2019s average and 30 percent below the year\u2019s high.<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin transaction fee<\/h2>\n<p>Yesterday\u2019s average transaction fee concerned $0.16. That\u2019s $3.54 below the year\u2019s high of $3.71.<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin distribution by address<\/h2>\n<p>As of now, there are 11,273 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 15.0 percent, and the top 1000 34.9 percent.<\/p>\n<h2>Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin<\/h2>\n<p>With a market capitalization of $132 billion, Netflix has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin\u2019s path towards $1 million<\/h2>\n<p>On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/officialmcafee\/status\/935900326007328768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">predicted<\/a> that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.<\/p>\n<p>He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn\u2019t. Unfortunately for him it\u2019s 95.2 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin\u2018s price should have been $153,545 by now, according to dickline.info.<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin on Twitter<\/h2>\n<p>Yesterday 16,592 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That\u2019s 9.6 percent below the year\u2019s average.

If you\u2019ve been on Twitter regularly for the past year, most of these probably won\u2019t come as a shock. Still, it\u2019s nice every once in a while to see what the social media site collectively obsessed over this year.<\/p>\n<p>The hashtags for the year paint a pretty bleak picture, as several of them concern natural disasters or regular man-made disasters. The top news-related hashtag was #NotreDame, concerning the tragic fire that destroyed most of the historic building. Other hashtags concern the Christchurch shooting, the Hong Kong protests, the Venezuela riots, Typhoon Hagibis in Japan, and the fire in the Amazon. It\u2019s not a happy microcosm of the year, but it does show how passionate Twitter users are when it comes to causes. In fact, many Hong Kong protesters <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/1698002\/hong-kong-protesters-flock-to-twitter-to-shape-global-message\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">joined Twitter specifically<\/a> to spread the word on what was happening to them.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>As for retweets, Twitter did note it wouldn\u2019t count <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yousuck2020\/status\/1081544630754103296\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">one particular tweet<\/a> from Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, which is actually the most retweeted tweet of all time. This is because Maezawa offered 100 million yen to 100 randomly selected retweeters, and Twitter disqualifies anyone who offers money as an incentive to retweet. Thank goodness for that, because I\u2019ve seen way too much of that on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out the tweet that (legitimately) nabbed the top spot for \u201cmost retweeted\u201d was an egg. And I don\u2019t mean an \u201cegg\u201d as in the slang term for a new account using the now-defunct egg as its default avatar \u2014 I mean an actual egg. The user asked for everyone to give it more retweets than Maezawa\u2019s tweet. It still baffles me that users can say \u201cLet\u2019s make X the most retweeted thing ever\u201d and Twitter just follows suit. Nowhere else in the world have I known internet mobs to be so compliant. But hey, all hail your new Twitter lord, this chicken egg.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Let's set a world record together and get the most retweeted tweet on Twitter.

The video shows youngest member Jungkook dancing. By itself, that\u2019s a sensation (yeah, I stan; deal with it). But, and meaning no offense to Jungkook, it\u2019s the third-most-retweeted video I love the most, because it\u2019s a bunch of grown men running screaming from a baby bird and that will never not be hilarious.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u26a0\ufe0fWATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK\u26a0\ufe0f <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/uNPzKfQKJH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">pic.twitter.com\/uNPzKfQKJH<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Ashton\ud83d\udc3b (@aman9919) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aman9919\/status\/1112768261832228865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">April 1, 2019<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><em>Game of Thrones<\/em> naturally dominated the discourse on TV, because its\u00a0<em>controversial<\/em> final season sparked more than a few online rants.

Meanwhile, Disney must be dancing in the aisle, because six of the most-discussed movies belong to it, with\u00a0<em>Avengers: Endgame\u00a0<\/em>taking the top slot.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Twitter hasn\u2019t changed much from last year\u2019s favorites. BTS still owns the world\u2019s heart, Marvel movies are tops, and adorable animals are adorable. But there\u2019s nothing really wrong with that, is there?<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>Several thousand audience ratings for\u00a0<em>Death Stranding\u00a0<\/em>have disappeared from Metacritic. The official reason for this is that these ratings were \u201csuspicious,\u201d and Metacritic doesn\u2019t want to become another site for review bombing.<\/p>\n<p>This was first spotted by Reddit user Argandg, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Games\/comments\/e6t4zm\/metacritic_removes_6400_negative_death_stranding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">who reported the exact numbers<\/a> to the r\/Games subreddit. They said they\u2019d noticed the user score decreasing slightly since the game\u2019s release as more people submitted negative ratings. Until a few days ago, when over 6,000 negative ratings were simply gone.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>This has undoubtedly affected the overall rating, as the total number of reviews has gone from over 18,000 to just over 12,000 at the time of this writing. That\u2019s not a small chunk.<\/p>\n<p>Metacritic later gave <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ign.com\/articles\/2019\/12\/07\/metacritic-removed-suspicious-death-stranding-user-ratings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a statement to IGN<\/a> saying that this move was done specifically to combat attempts to manipulate the rating:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A number of user generated reviews for Death Stranding were flagged for suspicious activity and have since been removed. Metacritic takes issues of potential score manipulation seriously and has a number of policies in place to maintain score integrity. Moderators regularly review the site and remove any entries that do not fall within our guidelines in addition to a moderation queue where Metacritic users can flag unusual behavior. Moderators then review and remove any entries that violate our terms of service.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given that the negative reviews didn\u2019t come in all at once, this would seem to be either the least- or most-organized review bombing in history. If we take Argandg\u2019s assessment as true, the ratings would come in at a rate of about 250 a day. Still, if Metacritic thinks they\u2019re suspicious, probably better safe than sorry \u2014 I can definitely see review bombing as being a problem for the site, and it\u2019s not something worth tolerating.<\/p>\n<p>Review bombing, for those who don\u2019t know, is the practice of flooding a review platform with negative reviews (or positive, in some rare cases). The intention is to \u201cpunish\u201d the film or game by driving down its overall rating and\/or hurting its sales. In the past, it\u2019s been used in response to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eurogamer.net\/articles\/2017-09-19-firewatch-steam-review-bomb-pewdiepie-racism-incident\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a developer\u2019s feud with a YouTuber<\/a>, to <a href=\"https:\/\/kotaku.com\/after-epic-store-deal-steam-users-review-bomb-metro-ga-1832209151\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">protest a game being an Epic Store exclusive<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/devotion-review-bombed-by-chinese-steam-users-over-winnie-the-pooh-meme\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">to express disgust for a political joke<\/a>, among other things. It\u2019s also been used in movies \u2014 one of the most infamous being the\u00a0<em>Captain Marvel<\/em> review bomb that caused Rotten Tomatoes to <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/insider\/2019\/05\/24\/rotten-tomatoes-new-audience-score-makes-you-prove-youve-seen-the-movie\/\">rejigger its audience reviewing rules<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure what issue anyone has with\u00a0<em>Death Stranding<\/em> specifically that could be causing people to bomb it. It\u2019s definitely not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but I don\u2019t recall it being the subject of any particular controversy. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Games\/comments\/e6t4zm\/metacritic_removes_6400_negative_death_stranding\/f9t0ov3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Argandg speculated<\/a> in the Reddit comments that this might have something to do with the Game Awards, which air this coming Thursday. The host, Geoff Keighley, has a cameo in the game and is longtime friends with its director, Hideo Kojima. To me, that\u2019d be a mark against Keighley, but I guess you can\u2019t review-bomb people.<\/p>\n<p>For the record, Keighley rejects the notion that it\u2019s a conflict of interest, as he doesn\u2019t vote on the nominees or select the winners. In a Reddit AMA, <a href=\"https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/IAmA\/comments\/e6jmix\/im_geoff_keighley_producer_of_the_game_awards_ama\/f9qxrs5\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">in response to a question on the topic<\/a>, he said, \u201c<span>That process isn\u2019t the result of me having a cameo in a game, but also because I work with developers on world premieres, announcements, sponsorships, and other aspects of the show\u2026\u00a0<\/span><span>I certainly get the concern. As producer of the show I\u2019m inevitably going to have relationships with people in the industry. That\u2019s what allows me to do the show in the first place.\u201d<\/span><\/p>",

After May 6, the app will no longer sync to the cloud, though you\u2019ll still be able to export your lists to Microsoft To Do. If you\u2019ve been holding onto hope of a Wunderlist resurgence, now seems like a good time to let go.

This is strikingly similar to how humans translate the 2D input from our eyes into a 3D mental image.<\/p>\n<p>According <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.nvidia.com\/blog\/2019\/12\/09\/neurips-research-3d\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">to Nvidia<\/a>, this research has numerous implications for the field of robotics:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For an autonomous robot to interact safely and efficiently with its environment, it must be able to sense and understand its surroundings. DIB-R could potentially improve those depth perception capabilities.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With further development the researchers hope to expand DIB-R to include functionality that would essentially make it a virtual reality renderer. One day, the team hopes, such a system will make it possible for the AI to create fully-immersive 3D worlds in milliseconds using only photographs:<\/p>\n<p>Sanja Fidler, Nvidia\u2019s director of AI and coauthor on the team\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/nv-tlabs.github.io\/DIB-R\/files\/diff_shader.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">paper<\/a>, told <a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2019\/12\/09\/nvidia-trains-ai-to-transform-2d-images-into-3d-models\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Venture Beat\u2019s<\/a> Khari Johnson:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine you can just take a photo and out comes a 3D model, which means that you can now look at that scene that you have taken a picture of [from] all sorts of different viewpoints. You can go inside it potentially, view it from different angles \u2014 you can take old photographs in your photo collection and turn them into a 3D scene and inspect them like you were there, basically.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The ability to render the world from photographs could lead to amazing content creation pipelines. Technology such as Google Maps could become more immersive than ever. And, possibly,\u00a0creatives more skilled at photography or painting than coding and development could leave all the heavy development to the machines.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine if making huge open-world games such as <em>Skyrim<\/em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto<\/em>, the kind traditionally relegated to companies with hundreds of staff members, were something a handful of creatives and an AI could handle on their own.<\/p>",

Most of us remember the exact moment we first saw the underwater city of Rapture, or when the game\u2019s signature story twist hit us. It\u2019s been six years since the last game in the series,\u00a0<em>BioShock Infinite<\/em>, which moved the series setting to the cloud city of Columbia. So where could we go from there?<\/p>\n<p>2K today revealed it\u2019d formed a new studio, called Cloud Chamber, and that it\u2019d take the lead on fresh\u00a0<em>BioShock\u00a0<\/em>development.\u00a0There aren\u2019t many announcements to make about the game at the moment, apart from the fact that it\u2019s on Cloud Chamber\u2019s drawing board. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamesradar.com\/uk\/we-have-a-myriad-of-ideas-cloud-chambers-kelley-gilmore-reveals-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-next-bioshock-game\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Gamesradar interviewed Kelley Gilmore<\/a>, formerly of Firaxis and the head of Cloud Chamber, who only said, \u201c<span>There are many creative directions to explore,\u00a0but you\u2019ll have to wait a bit longer to see where we go next.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Considering the series has already gone over the clouds and under the sea, it\u2019s hard to imagine where else the devs could take it. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not excited to find out, but the BioShock series has always thrived by making its location the focal point, almost to the extreme of making it a character. I want to see more of that.<\/p>\n<p>It\u00a0<em>is\u00a0<\/em>a bit of a disappointment that Ken Levine, the game\u2019s original creator, won\u2019t have a hand in this game \u2014 though not a surprise. Levine has spoken candidly about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/why-ken-levine-stopped-making-bioshock-games\/1100-6443595\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">having no interest<\/a> in another\u00a0<em>BioShock\u00a0<\/em>game, as the making of\u00a0<em>Infinite<\/em> left him exhausted. He\u2019s currently working on his own projects with Ghost Story Games, a studio he founded along with several other former\u00a0<em>BioShock\u00a0<\/em>developers.<\/p>\n<p>Two out of the three existing BioShock games have been critical successes, and even\u00a0<em>BioShock 2<\/em> wasn\u2019t a slouch. I think it\u2019s very telling that, when asked about why 2K decided to make a new\u00a0<em>BioShock<\/em>, Gilmore pointed out what a good seller the franchise has been up to this point:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span>It\u2019s been awhile since the last release, but BioShock is still one of the most popular, critically praised and highest-rated franchises of the last console generation. The franchise has a lifetime sell-in of over 34 million units, and Cloud Chamber is honored and excited to create the next great game in the series.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Either way, it\u2019s going to be a while before we see the new BioShock. 2K said in <a href=\"https:\/\/ir.take2games.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/2k-announces-newly-formed-studio-cloud-chambertm-developing-next?field_nir_news_date_value%5Bmin%5D=2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">its announcement<\/a> that the game will be in development over \u201cthe next several years.\u201d That means there\u2019s plenty of time to get your ideas in. Where do you think the series should go next, philosophically or physically? Tag me in any and all Twitter debates.<\/p>",

Starting today, the company will regularly update its Pixel devices through a series of Pixel feature drops meant to improve Pixels old and new. The company is kicking things off with a series of genuinely useful additions.<\/p>\n<p>Most notably, Google will now let you go back in time and add portrait mode to\u00a0<em>any<\/em> of your old pictures of people. In other words, this isn\u2019t just the ability to edit the amount of blur after taking a portrait mode photo, but rather to retroactively add portrait mode to a plain old picture.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260695 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"560\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/05_Add_Portrait_Blur_to_Photos_EN_1_zbRXS4H.gif\" data-lazy=\"true\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Google isn\u2019t explaining how it works just yet, but presumably, the company is using AI to create a depth map based on data on actual portrait photos. After all, that\u2019s basically how the company does portrait mode with its front-facing cameras without actually having a second sensor for depth.<\/p>\n<p>How well it works will likely depend on the quality and resolution of the photos, but it\u2019s pretty sweet the company is suddenly giving you all this flexibility with old photos. There have definitely been instances I wish I\u2019d turned on portrait mode but hadn\u2019t had the foresight. Better yet, the company tells me the feature works with any image in your Google Photos account, not just ones taken on Pixel devices.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1260692 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"399\" height=\"399\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Call_Screen.gif\" data-lazy=\"true\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Photos aside, Google now helps you screen and filter unknown callers and robocalls\u00a0<em>before<\/em> your phone rings, as opposed to just alerting you when they might be potential spam. If it\u2019s not a robocall, your phone will alert you with context on who might be calling.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, the company is improving Duo video calls by automatically centering video even as you move around. The camera is even smart enough to adjust the field of view should someone enter the frame. You\u2019ll also now be able to add a video \u2018portrait filter,\u2019 basically blurring out your background to keep the emphasis on you. On the audio front, Google is now using predictive AI to make up for small gaps in a spotty connection.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260694 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"560\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/08_Duo_Portrait_Mode_EN_var06_191115.gif\" data-lazy=\"true\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>There are a few other updates, including improved memory management and bringing some of the Pixel 4\u2019s features to older devices, which you can read about in Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/pixel\/more-helpful-pixel-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">announcement post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYour phone should get better over time,\u201d says Google. I couldn\u2019t agree more, and it\u2019s a pleasant surprise to see Google placing greater emphasis on adding features to its phones <em>after<\/em> their release. It\u2019s one of the reasons Apple is able to maintain such strong customer loyalty, so\u00a0let\u2019s hope Google keeps these Pixel drops interesting.<\/p><p><i>For more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/plugged\">Twitter<\/a> and\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/flipboard.com\/@thenextweb\/plugged-54nihknvy\">Flipboard<\/a>.\n            <\/i><\/p>",

The perps also tell victims they can purchase prepaid debit cards or gift cards to satisfy the bogus fine.<\/p>\n<p>According to the US Marshals, scammers will provide badge numbers, names of real law enforcement agents, and federal judges to sound credible. But these are nothing more than diversion tactics.<\/p>\n<p>The US Marshals also say the scammers spoof their phone numbers to make them appear as if they are calling from a legitimate government number.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear if the US Marshals\u2019 update comes in response to an uptick in reported crimes of this nature. However, its full update does say that, in November, scammers had demanded victims deposit money via Bitcoin ATMs.<\/p>\n<p>This is hardly a new strategy for cryptocurrency con artists, though.<\/p>\n<p>In October last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/hardfork\/2018\/10\/05\/bitcoin-atm-scam-australia\/\">Hard Fork reported<\/a> that fraudsters had been targeting Australian immigrants, saying that they needed to pay a tax or else they would risk deportation. Like this instance, scammers urged victims to pay via Bitcoin ATMs.<\/p>",

Trigger warnings are like warnings or labels you put on movies, music, lectures, books, etc, to let people know that there is a topic covered that\u2019s distressing. The biggest, or most talked about, example is sexual assault.<\/p>\n<p><strong id=\"m_7788645031028246601docs-internal-guid-46fba2e0-7fff-0f60-4433-e3678c380613\">Cara:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>I haven\u2019t seen trigger warnings hiding sexual assault online since that violates guidelines on social media. It\u2019s more like animal abuse to raise awareness, that I\u2019ve seen.\u00a0Can you send an example of an IRL trigger warning?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong id=\"m_7788645031028246601docs-internal-guid-a19f042c-7fff-9328-d712-699a62d3ecad\">Georgina:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>The\u00a0biggest example in my experience was in university. When there was a lecture that discussed sexual assault, professors often give trigger warnings at the start. This turned into a huge discussion because some people felt like it dampened intellectual discussion by allowing people to excuse themselves from class. Some also argued that \u201cyou can\u2019t have a trigger warning for life,\u201d because life is upsetting and you will have to deal with confronting material.<\/p>\n<p><strong id=\"m_7788645031028246601docs-internal-guid-ba4aa0c3-7fff-485e-1536-f1c4111942f8\">Anouk:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Isn\u2019t talking about it beneficial though?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong id=\"m_7788645031028246601docs-internal-guid-0223b099-7fff-6bd5-7b29-4ea6bef215de\">Cara:<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>I\u2019d argue yes, but depends on the situation. If it\u2019s something that was fresh, or their still dealing with, it can be traumatizing.

In vulnerable hotspots, such as the arid lands of Kenya and Ethiopia, farming communities are already struggling with droughts and water scarcity that kill their cattle and threaten their very survival. The glacial-fed river basins of the Himalayan mountains, or the deltas of Bangladesh, India , and Ghana, are increasingly prone to floods, landslides, and powerful cyclones.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, men are often migrating further to keep their families going, looking for casual work in neighboring towns or villages for a few days or weeks at a time, or to cities further away. Many try to return home when they can, with whatever they have earned.

Longstanding gender inequality means that within regions of the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, women are likely to suffer more than men.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304928\/original\/file-20191203-67002-1ntte0.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304928\/original\/file-20191203-67002-1ntte0.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304928\/original\/file-20191203-67002-1ntte0.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304928\/original\/file-20191203-67002-1ntte0.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304928\/original\/file-20191203-67002-1ntte0.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304928\/original\/file-20191203-67002-1ntte0.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304928\/original\/file-20191203-67002-1ntte0.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F09%2Fthe-climate-crisis-threatens-gender-equality-in-africa%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: A woman leads goats to graze and water in the Moyar Bhavani Basin, India.

Without support in the form of assured drinking water, energy, childcare or credit, women end up working harder and in poorer conditions for lower wages.<\/p>\n<p>Women already in poverty are increasingly finding themselves in a vicious cycle of low productivity, indebtedness and food insecurity as crops and livestock fail, as we found particularly in semi-arid parts of Africa and India. Women in northern Kenya complained that they could no longer afford meat, so they ate rice and potatoes instead, even when this wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy their hunger.<\/p>\n<p>As environmental stresses accumulate, community support networks break down. When people are displaced and have to settle elsewhere, men search for work and women are left behind at home, often in unfamiliar surroundings and lacking support from friends and relatives. But even if they do know people, with all the challenges of running the household in a strange environment, there is little time to help others.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304941\/original\/file-20191203-67034-uo4zp9.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304941\/original\/file-20191203-67034-uo4zp9.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304941\/original\/file-20191203-67034-uo4zp9.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304941\/original\/file-20191203-67034-uo4zp9.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304941\/original\/file-20191203-67034-uo4zp9.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304941\/original\/file-20191203-67034-uo4zp9.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304941\/original\/file-20191203-67034-uo4zp9.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F09%2Fthe-climate-crisis-threatens-gender-equality-in-africa%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: As men migrate to find work, women have to shoulder the burden of housework, farming, and childcare.

Prathigna Poonacha, Author provided<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p><\/figure><p>With full responsibility for household chores, farming and caring for the children and elderly, women have less time to socialize or take part in community events, including meetings of the elected village government. If the state or charities can help, there\u2019s often competition for securing those benefits. In Namibia, people tend to stick with their ethnic groups to guarantee access through collective effort, but this means that ethnic minorities in the region are often excluded.<\/p>\n<p>In Mali, heavier burdens are placed on women who are young and less educated. In India or Pakistan, women belonging to a lower social class or marginal caste suffer the most. Gender relations differ in each place and according to each situation \u2013 they\u2019re often too variable to emerge in broad national and global assessments. We tried to find a way to generalize our findings across 25 very diverse locations, in Asia and Africa, without losing the nuance of each woman\u2019s experiences.<\/p>\n<h2>The bare necessities<\/h2>\n<p>If much of the problem is structural, then short-term solutions like cyclone shelters or drought relief won\u2019t address the underlying causes of poverty and precariousness. Social safety nets that can ensure the basic necessities of food and shelter are needed, like the public distribution system for cereals in India, or the pensions and social grants available in Namibia.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure that the health of people in these places doesn\u2019t irreversibly decline, women need to be supported with child and healthcare services but also drinking water and cooking fuel. The role of community support is crucial during crises, but there\u2019s little that women can do to help themselves without resources and skills.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304922\/original\/file-20191203-66994-1p4c8mx.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304922\/original\/file-20191203-66994-1p4c8mx.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304922\/original\/file-20191203-66994-1p4c8mx.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304922\/original\/file-20191203-66994-1p4c8mx.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304922\/original\/file-20191203-66994-1p4c8mx.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304922\/original\/file-20191203-66994-1p4c8mx.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304922\/original\/file-20191203-66994-1p4c8mx.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F09%2Fthe-climate-crisis-threatens-gender-equality-in-africa%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: A woman collects drinking water from a well in Bangalore, India.

Ensuring minimum wages and fair working conditions would help, but these are hard to implement across borders.

So it won\u2019t be surprising if OnePlus releases a sub-$400 phone the next year.<\/p>\n<p>It would be interesting to see if OnePlus will launch three models \u2013 the OnePlus 8 \u2018lite\u2019, the OnePlus 8, and the OnePlus 8 Pro \u2013 next year.

More recently, research shows that even preschoolers have a preference for playing with children of their own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/17405620903506988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ethnicity<\/a> or those who speak the same <a href=\"https:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/fulltext\/1994-37011-001.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">language<\/a>.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>One evolutionary hypothesis for our tendency toward ingroup loyalty is that it would have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19498163\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">advantageous<\/a> to our tribal hunter-gatherer ancestors in their competition with rival tribes (as groups with more loyal and devoted members would have been more likely to survive and reproduce). The warring behavior is seen in our chimpanzee cousins, who form coalitions to steal the territory of rival groups, are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cell.com\/current-biology\/fulltext\/S0960-9822%2810%2900459-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">cited<\/a> as evidence that supports this theory.<\/p>\n<p>Yet chimps might not be the most apposite species comparison for understanding humans, and there is a more optimistic perspective on human intergroup behavior, one that has been largely neglected by scientists to date. In a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/evan.21793\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">issue<\/a> of <em>Evolutionary Anthropology<\/em>, Anne Pisor at Washington State University and Martin Surbeck at Harvard University explain that, among primates, humans are an \u2018outlier\u2019. We have a highly flexible approach to outsiders: that is we are capable of being highly tolerant \u2013 encountering and dealing with outsiders or \u2018out-group members\u2019 without resorting to violence \u2013 as well as being aggressive. How does that square with our picture of warring hominin bands in our evolutionary history?<\/p>\n<p>Like many social animals, including several primate species, and also dolphins and elephants, we humans live in what is known as \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10682-006-9141-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fission-fusion<\/a>\u2019 societies \u2013 our allegiances are flexible; there is a fluidity in the size of groups into which we coalesce; and the boundaries between our groups or tribes are porous, depending on the circumstances. For instance, when food is abundant, individual members of fission-fusion species will temporarily dissolve their smaller formal groups and intermingle <em>en masse<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, when food is scarce, individuals will split into rival groups to search for food in different locations. Peaceful intermingling can also occur in other circumstances, such as when individuals from one group go on reconnaissance to observe where other groups are finding their spoils. And in pursuit of mating opportunities, individuals of one group will complete a transfer into a different group \u2013 a process that might be preceded by earlier intermingling and reconnaissance.<\/p>\n<p>These sociable, outward-looking tendencies that allow us to bend with the circumstances are as much a part of our evolved nature as our proclivity for tribal loyalty and bellicosity. Picture a crowded London park mid-summer. Sunbathers, readers, ball kickers, strollers and picnic lovers united in the shared human enjoyment of a little warmth. Like the sunshine, it might not last that long (it\u2019s an abundant though seasonal resource), but momentarily at least there\u2019s a communal mood in the air. The boundaries of the park bring us physically closer than we might usually find comfortable, but we don\u2019t mind \u2013 it\u2019s in our nature as a fission-fusion species to enjoy, or at least tolerate, such moments all together.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Pisor and Surbeck believe that we have evolved to be uniquely tolerant among fission-fusion species and that the roots of this lie in part in our unusually large brains and relatively high reproductive rates, compared with other primates. Together these characteristics make us extremely dependent on high-quality, high-risk (ie, unpredictable across time and location) food and tool supplies. In turn, this will have had implications for our foraging strategies, including the frequent need to rely on other communities during periods of resource scarcity. \u2018This does not mean humans were, or are, peaceful all the time,\u2019 Pisor told me. \u2018But, where and when access to nonlocal resources is important, humans have often managed to find ways to be tolerant towards members of other communities at least some of the time.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Whereas scholars have previously focused on bellicose chimpanzees as a way to gain insight into the evolutionary origins of our aggressive tendencies, Pisor and Surbeck believe comparisons with other, more tolerant nonhuman primates might be more apposite, especially for understanding the foundations of our uniquely tolerant nature.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, food sharing and grooming have both been observed between bonobo groups, as has the formation of intergroup coalitions. \u2018Bonobos aren\u2019t always tolerant toward members of other groups,\u2019 Pisor said. \u2018During intergroup encounters, there are often conflicts between two individuals or even moments of tension that shake up many members of both groups. But that flexibility in intergroup behavior, to behave tolerantly or aggressively toward out-group members, is there, much like the flexibility we see in humans.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Other nonhuman primates that display advantageous tolerant behavior (though not to the same degree as humans) include Tamarin monkeys, who have been <a href=\"https:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/record\/2000-14435-002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">observed<\/a> forming mixed-species groups, learning new foraging strategies in the process; and <a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/ajp.20736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">baboons<\/a>, who forage together (without breaking into separate groups or \u2018bands\u2019) when food is abundant and also come together to form huge \u2018troops\u2019 for greater protection at night.<\/p>\n<p>A field of human campers gathered tent-to-tent under the moonlight is not so different from the scene of hundreds of baboons huddled together on the cliff-side at night. Just as our aggressive tendencies might have deep evolutionary roots that are apparent in the behavior of nonhuman primates, so too do our instincts for tolerance and peaceful coexistence.<\/p>\n<p>We can also see traces of this evolved tolerance and cooperation in the way that we value leaders. We tend to attribute high status to individuals who are \u2018well-connected\u2019, especially during times when much-needed resources are not available locally \u2013 a phenomenon apparent in traditional societies. Pisor and Surbeck point, for example, to studies of the Coast Salish (Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast), who in the 19th century attributed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3629261?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">high status<\/a> to male village members who had the most ties to other communities. We tend to think of male warriors as enjoying all the power and glory, which might well be true during periods of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9781493908660\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">war<\/a>. But less acknowledged is that, in more peaceful circumstances, it is the cooperators and diplomats \u2013 the ones who build alliances, not break them \u2013 who enjoy high esteem. There are parallels here with the distinction <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/0963721417714323\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">drawn<\/a> by evolutionary psychologists between prestige-based leadership and dominance-oriented leadership \u2013 the former based more on the ability to share skills and expertise, the latter on the ability to rule by fear.<\/p>\n<p>Pisor and Surbeck argue too that social institutions (ie, group rules governing appropriate social behavior toward outsiders) have emerged in human history to encourage and enhance inter-community cooperation during times when tolerance toward outsiders and dealings with them is particularly advantageous. For instance, ingroup members who cheat the outgroup might be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/2945838?read-now=1&amp;seq=16#metadata_info_tab_contents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">sanctioned<\/a> if their behavior might imperil the benefits of between-group cooperation.<\/p>\n<p>This is at odds with our conventional view of ingroup loyalty and outgroup hostility: it\u2019s not too much of a stretch to see these dynamics playing out in contemporary politics, with some making public their desire to punish their own prominent group members who would endanger relationships with outgroups.<\/p>\n<p>Since Thomas Hobbes\u2019s bleak assessment in the 17th century of the natural state of humankind, it has been fashionable in many quarters to <a href=\"https:\/\/aeon.co\/ideas\/the-bad-news-on-human-nature-in-10-findings-from-psychology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">highlight<\/a> the darker sides of human nature. As the historian, Erika Lorraine Milam explained in her Aeon <a href=\"https:\/\/aeon.co\/essays\/we-still-live-in-the-long-shadow-cast-by-the-idea-of-man-the-hunter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">essay<\/a> last year, the problem with using evidence from our deep past to make claims about human nature is that it\u2019s all too easy to cherrypick to present a simplistic, biased picture.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s true that we humans are inclined toward favoring our own \u2018kind\u2019, and our reputation for acts of horrific violence and hatred is not unwarranted. Yet this timely new review reminds us there is another, equally important aspect to our nature \u2013 our unique capacity for tolerance, not only to our own group but well beyond it.<img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Aeon counter \u2013 do not remove\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/metrics.aeon.co\/count\/22ee2e60-c4c1-41ee-91ba-90905becb2da.gif\" data-lazy=\"true\"><\/p>\n<p><em>This article was written by Christian Jarrett and originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/aeon.co?utm_campaign=republished-article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Aeon<\/a> and has been republished under Creative Commons.<\/em><\/p>",

Ultimately, we agreed that we should highlight and support titles that make true strides.

It takes a lot of work, from the most minute detail to the most grandiose messages sent to the player. To appreciate this feat we can study the characters, major locations, the game\u2019s respective influences, as well as how they all work together.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ac1a\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hy iz\"><em class=\"iy\">Note: Light story spoilers will be present throughout this article.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"9bda\" class=\"jh ji fo ar aq jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju\">Character<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"jb jc jd je jf ev ei ej paragraph-image\"><div class=\"ex ey bl ez ak\">\n<div class=\"ei ej jv\">\n<div class=\"fe r bl ff\">\n<div class=\"jw r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oy rb cr t u fb ak fk lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"370\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1050\/0*nkOdgLeWZ_KszawU\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F08%2Fheres-why-indivisible-is-the-most-diverse-and-inclusive-game-of-2019%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Ajna Illustration by Yoh Yoshinari of Studio Trigger.\" data-title=\"Share Ajna Illustration by Yoh Yoshinari of Studio Trigger. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Ajna Illustration by Yoh Yoshinari of Studio Trigger. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Ajna Illustration by Yoh Yoshinari of Studio Trigger.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><p id=\"0386\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">First, we have excellent use of characters and there\u2019s no better example than Ajna herself. Our protagonist bodes well from a representation standpoint; starting with her seemingly simple design and name. In terms of design, the first thing we notice is that she\u2019s a brown-skinned young woman (still a rarity for gaming protagonists). She\u2019s also a capable fighter and takes charge, as any leader would. The prayer beads that rest on her head inform us that she\u2019s influenced (to a degree) by her respective culture\u2019s beliefs. Her clothing indicates that she isn\u2019t Western\/European influenced \u2014 as many RPG protagonists tend to be.<\/p>\n<p id=\"edf3\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The power of character goes further with her name. Additional research reveals that Ajna\u2019s namesake is representative of the title\u2019s plot and themes.<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ajna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ajna<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>is the third-eye<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chakra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">chakra<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>in the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hinduism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hindu<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>tradition. It\u2019s known to function like a muscle that gets stronger through training: meditation, spiritual practice and so on. It is the subconscious mind and it helps guide someone through the world. The ever-present importance of the Ajna permeates the game \u2014even the logo.<\/p>\n<p id=\"1b58\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Our protagonist\u2019s power is made apparent right at the beginning of the game as she unwittingly absorbs someone into her mind. Afterward, she becomes a lightning rod to those who more or less work towards the greater good. Her subconscious (inner realm) grows and flourishes with the more comrades you recruit. At first, it appears to be a small island and then eventually a giant tree surrounded by floating islands. This reinforces that being better in body, mind, and spirit is paramount to saving the world.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"jb jc jd je jf ev fk kd hj ke il kf kg kh bv cl ki kj kk kl az paragraph-image\"><div class=\"ex ey bl ez ak\">\n<div class=\"ei ej kc\">\n<div class=\"fe r bl ff\">\n<div class=\"km r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oy rb cr t u fb ak fk lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"531\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/695\/0*2YQUj_yq826_fXKr\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F08%2Fheres-why-indivisible-is-the-most-diverse-and-inclusive-game-of-2019%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Lab Zero Games, Ajna.\" data-title=\"Share Lab Zero Games, Ajna. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Lab Zero Games, Ajna. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Lab Zero Games, Ajna.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><p id=\"b37a\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Ajna certainly isn\u2019t the first RPG lead to be influenced by religious themes and methodologies. She is, however, one of the few leads to be inspired heavily by non-Judeo Christian and otherwise Western concepts.

Every major city and area is based on real-world cities and regions. Let\u2019s take a closer look at a few key areas.<\/p>\n<p id=\"a485\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">First, we can study Tai Krung City, pictured above. The city is quite possibly a fictionalized Chinese town. The design and function of the housing have quite a striking resemblance. Buildings and structures in Tai Krung reach the height of skyscrapers. Thus, you\u2019re constantly climbing above homes and businesses built upon each other to eventually reach a massive tower (the tower being both a literal and figurative show of power for the corruption that exists in the world).<\/p>\n<p id=\"ad4e\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">From a narrative standpoint, any similarities with China appear to go beyond the surface aesthetic \u2014 including even possible references to a troubled past. Upon arrival, Ajna and company learn that one of the major problems the people face is drug addiction (one can\u2019t help but notice this could be similar to China\u2019s history with<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_opium_in_China\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">opium<\/a>). Although I\u2019m speaking of this in a general sense, it was a very serious issue. The harm in Tai Krung was also brought about by a dangerous outside element looking to take over. The suffering of the populace naturally, becomes a piece of the game\u2019s larger plot.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"jb jc jd je jf ev fk kd hj ke il kf kg kh bv cl ki kj kk kl az paragraph-image\"><div class=\"ex ey bl ez ak\">\n<div class=\"ei ej kp\">\n<div class=\"fe r bl ff\">\n<div class=\"kq r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oy rb cr t u fb ak fk lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"513\" height=\"712\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/600\/0*grAzmnYPSX14rVyi\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F08%2Fheres-why-indivisible-is-the-most-diverse-and-inclusive-game-of-2019%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Lab Zero Games, Kaanul Concept.\" data-title=\"Share Lab Zero Games, Kaanul Concept. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Lab Zero Games, Kaanul Concept. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Lab Zero Games, Kaanul Concept.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><p id=\"6291\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I could be mistaken, but the region of Kaanul most certainly appears to take cues from<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mesoamerica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mesoamerica<\/a>. First impressions include the impressive architecture we see upon our first visit. Players traverse what appears to be an inverted pyramid as they descend into the land.

There\u2019s a strong royal presence via Queen Mary ruling with an iron fist (iron first, iron kingdom\u2026heh).<\/p>\n<h2>Aesthetics<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"jb jc jd je jf ev ei ej paragraph-image\"><div class=\"ex ey bl ez ak\">\n<div class=\"ei ej kn\">\n<div class=\"fe r bl ff\">\n<div class=\"kr r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oy rb cr t u fb ak fk lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"321\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*HbKc3IfL99bJ_FgI\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F08%2Fheres-why-indivisible-is-the-most-diverse-and-inclusive-game-of-2019%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Lab Zero Games, Inner Realm.\" data-title=\"Share Lab Zero Games, Inner Realm. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Lab Zero Games, Inner Realm. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Lab Zero Games, Inner Realm.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><p id=\"dee2\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of the most impressive aspects of<span>\u00a0<\/span><em class=\"iy\">Indivisible<\/em><span>\u00a0<\/span>is the tone of the game overall; the experience is intrinsically spiritual yet it achieves this without heavy and obvious exposition to the player. This theme is played out in the most salient way through Anja\u2019s growth as both a person and a leader \u2014 even if it is all much to her chagrin early on.<\/p>\n<p id=\"12d7\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As her powers and duties grow she is advised to seek counsel and sage advice \u2014 if and\/or when necessary. Much of this comes from the character\/party member<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/indivisible.fandom.com\/wiki\/Thorani\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Thorani<\/a>. She, more than anyone, speaks mostly to Ajna of her abilities, recognizing her faults, altruism, and so on. Also, Thorani isn\u2019t a mere human, she\u2019s quite literally a goddess. So her words and actions carry significant weight. Our leader is, after all, brash and never backs down, so of course, needs a support system to remind her to look before she leaps.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8b7f\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The pervasive themes of spirituality can be seen again with Ajna\u2019s inner realm. It\u2019s home to all incarnations (allies), combatant or otherwise. This small space will eventually blossom into a beautiful land where you can quite literally train and get stronger (defensively and offensively). At the outset, it wasn\u2019t much to sneeze at, but in time, it serves as a visual reminder of what we can do.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"jb jc jd je jf ev fk kd hj ke il kf kg kh bv cl ki kj kk kl az paragraph-image\"><div class=\"ex ey bl ez ak\">\n<div class=\"ei ej kp\">\n<div class=\"fe r bl ff\">\n<div class=\"ks r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oy rb cr t u fb ak fk lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"462\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/600\/0*mILmHHkgFJy7hhXC\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F08%2Fheres-why-indivisible-is-the-most-diverse-and-inclusive-game-of-2019%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Lab Zero Games, Tzitzi and Serpent Queen.\" data-title=\"Share Lab Zero Games, Tzitzi and Serpent Queen. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Lab Zero Games, Tzitzi and Serpent Queen. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Lab Zero Games, Tzitzi and Serpent Queen.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><p id=\"8029\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Let\u2019s not forget how and where we can save progress, too. Throughout the game we can find shrines; much like their real-world counterparts, they can be seen anywhere and everywhere. Shrines are not unique to any particular faith or belief, so it makes sense to see them in the Iron Kingdom as much as Tai Krung City. Their cultural significance to society is certainly something most people can recognize.<\/p>\n<p id=\"00d9\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Each time you want to save, Ajna takes a prayer stance, and then we hear a very audible<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Om#Origin_and_meaning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">om<\/a>. Om can be understood to be a cosmic sound; affirmation to something divine. It possesses many definitions, one of those being infinite language\/infinite knowledge. Its a part of iconography for Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. So, it\u2019s a powerful acknowledgment of what influences the game and its heroine. It\u2019s a literal cue of the game\u2019s journey; the enrichment of everyone in body, mind, and spirit.<\/p>\n<p id=\"3c79\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As I examine key elements of the game, I would be remiss to not mention the obvious; I\u2019m providing very general ideas and thoughts here. The development team thoroughly studied a myriad of religions, cultures, and spiritual themes. Here, I would like to take a step back and appreciate the sheer amount of work that was clearly involved. To be able to leverage these complexities \u2014 with their deep and fascinating histories \u2014 is nothing short of admirable. Keep in mind, the team took concepts that have existed for eons and translated them into a work of fiction.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"jb jc jd je jf ev\"><div class=\"fe r bl\">\n<div class=\"uf r\"><iframe class=\"cr t u fb ak\" title=\"Jeffrey Rousseau on Twitter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.embedly.com\/widgets\/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A\/\/twitter.com\/jrpotential\/status\/1185221870821527556&amp;image=https%3A\/\/i.embed.ly\/1\/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpbs.twimg.com%252Fext_tw_video_thumb%252F1185221594106474496%252Fpu%252Fimg%252Fk6fyBQpNu_ApEPiR.jpg%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" width=\"680\" height=\"462\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><h2 id=\"3d14\" class=\"jh ji fo ar aq jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju\">Challenging dominant culture<\/h2>\n<p id=\"6a16\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ku ib kv id kw if kx ih ky ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Thus far, you may be wondering why is everything I\u2019ve drawn attention to important? Simply put, it challenges the dominant culture of games.<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dominant_culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dominant Culture<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>refers to what is perceived to be \u201cthe norm\u201d by the majority.<\/p>\n<p id=\"104d\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"iy\">Indivisible<\/em><span>\u00a0<\/span>does this in an abundance of ways. The most effective way this is accomplished is again with its characters. Most of Ajna\u2019s allies\/advisers\/guides in the game are women, femmes, and non-binary people. This is never questioned or needs to be explained. Like in real life, we have these leaders because they are capable and inspire others to do the same. On that same note, how many games have released this year that can claim the same?<\/p>\n<p id=\"44da\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">During her EGX 2019 panel, Jay-Ann Lopez, founder of Black Girl Gamers spoke about the dominant gaming culture. One key theme in her important talk was that to influence dominant culture we need\u00a0<strong class=\"hy iz\"><em class=\"iy\">authentic representation<\/em><\/strong>. Naturally, this includes the full spectrum of experiences: race, gender, identity, and so forth. The inclusion of these experiences into gaming content may allow games to become as diverse as TV and film have increasingly been in recent years.<\/p>\n<p id=\"b68e\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Let\u2019s for a moment focus on the question of authenticity; this is how Lab Zero was able to provide a game where marginalized experiences are commonplace. When we see queer comrades in the game, for example, their existence is very much a natural part of the world without feeling shoehorned in some explicit way. It\u2019s not just these comrades, either: multiple random NPCs you speak to exhibit similarly diverse backgrounds. The point here is that we aren\u2019t just talking about one or two people \u2014 marginalized individuals make up a natural part of the overall world and are recognized at large. For this reason, I never detected a hint of tokenism throughout the experience.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ac66\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The same can also be said about how<span>\u00a0<\/span><em class=\"iy\">Indivisible<\/em><span>\u00a0<\/span>recognizes body positivity. How many games allow you to work with characters like Phoebe, Tungar, Ginseng, and Honey? How many even feature disabled heroines like Yan? The answer is very few. What\u2019s important is that this game was able to include them and they are most certainly seen by everyone, as any human being deserves.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"c56c\" class=\"jh ji fo ar aq jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju\">The How<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"jb jc jd je jf ev ei ej paragraph-image\"><div class=\"ex ey bl ez ak\">\n<div class=\"ei ej la\">\n<div class=\"fe r bl ff\">\n<div class=\"lb r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oy rb cr t u fb ak fk lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"529\" height=\"298\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1918\/0*IHeBbK3a4nN-wFTO.png\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F08%2Fheres-why-indivisible-is-the-most-diverse-and-inclusive-game-of-2019%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Lab Zero Games.\" data-title=\"Share Lab Zero Games. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Lab Zero Games. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Lab Zero Games.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><p id=\"cc58\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">By now, everything I\u2019ve written here makes<span>\u00a0<\/span><em class=\"iy\">Indivisible<\/em><span>\u00a0<\/span>seem like a rarity in gaming.

How did such a progressive title emerge?<\/p>\n<p id=\"2a1e\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The simple answer is that developer Lab Zero Games had full creative control. They were able to collaborate and make their vision a reality on their own terms.<span>\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"bo hk iu iv iw ix\" href=\"https:\/\/www.indiegogo.com\/projects\/indivisible-rpg-from-the-creators-of-skullgirls#\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Back in 2015<\/a>, they launched a successful crowdfunding campaign. Soon thereafter they partnered with publisher 505 games. Then and now, the message was the same; they wanted to deliver an experience that only they could provide.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c2d9\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I vaguely recall their decision to chose the route of crowdfunding. If they were to pitch their idea to publishers, changes would\u2019ve been made. So what does that mean? Well, Ajna, probably wouldn\u2019t have been brown or a young woman. Most allies may instead have been men. Most characters probably wouldn\u2019t be a shade of black or brown. I could go on and on.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"jb jc jd je jf ev ei ej paragraph-image\"><div class=\"ex ey bl ez ak\">\n<div class=\"ei ej lc\">\n<div class=\"fe r bl ff\">\n<div class=\"ld r\">\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"oy rb cr t u fb ak fk lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"507\" height=\"358\" data-src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1200\/0*IM1aYEyF1_2_M93v\" data-lazy=\"true\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F08%2Fheres-why-indivisible-is-the-most-diverse-and-inclusive-game-of-2019%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Thorani illustration, Studio Trigger.\" data-title=\"Share Thorani illustration, Studio Trigger. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share Thorani illustration, Studio Trigger. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>Thorani illustration, Studio Trigger.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><blockquote class=\"le lf lg\">\n<p id=\"c528\" class=\"hw hx fo iy hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\u201cI want to love<span>\u00a0<\/span><em class=\"ar\">Indivisible<\/em><span>\u00a0<\/span>unconditionally; it has so many great pieces, and it\u2019s a special thing to feel<span>\u00a0<\/span><em class=\"ar\">seen<\/em>.

However, the point I making proves itself when you try to think of the obvious. How many high profile games have released in 2019 with non-white protagonists? How many with a large number of people who are visibly black and brown as allies? How many that aren\u2019t heavily influenced by Western aesthetics?<\/p>\n<p id=\"4fa9\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Perhaps one of the major answers to having better representation in games is to allow creators to have creative control. If they are allowed to fully create games that are truly representative of the world, then greater diversity may be achieved without pernicious tokenism. The problem here, however, is that Lab Zero still needed to crowdfund this game. Crowdfunding success, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t happen for everyone that tries.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ffd3\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">To be fair, games are getting a little better with having fully fleshed out marginalized game characters. But from titles like, say,<span>\u00a0<\/span><em class=\"iy\">Overwatch<\/em>, single-player games seem to mostly just checkboxes off (a minority here or there, the main character might be queer, and so forth).

Earlier, I mentioned that to help the conversation around improved representation, we have to regularly speak about it.<span>\u00a0<\/span><em class=\"iy\">Indivisible<\/em>, in my view, does a great job and manages to stand out from the pack. You\u2019re going on a journey with a young woman and her comrades that look like you and I (alternatively, you\u2019re walking in the shoes of a character who is very different than yourself, and may, therefore, illuminate a significantly different experience than your own).<\/p>\n<p id=\"049a\" class=\"hw hx fo ar hy b hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As a minority, it\u2019s often frustrating to not see regular coverage of this nature.

Equipping existing urban centers with the latest technology, though, is a different challenge entirely.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Cities shaped over centuries by the demands of different civilizations, where horses once pulled carriages, are gradually transitioning to a<span>\u00a0<\/span><span>smarter<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span>future. AI-directed traffic, smart parking and other intelligent infrastructure are taking its place on streets that were originally built to serve very different needs.<\/p>\n<p>If these ancient cities are to transition successfully, suggests smart city strategist<span>\u00a0Renato De Castro<\/span>, the DNA of the city must be preserved\u2014with new technologies woven into the historic urban fabric in a way that respects the ancient spirit of the place.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople have a deep connection with their cities, even deeper than with their province, region or country,\u201d says De Castro in an interview to BDJ.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo understand the unique DNA of the city and translate it into a strategy to develop a wiser city will be crucial for the success of any project. Citizens do not want a new city, they want a better city to live in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A city that by all rules of nature should be two meters underwater, Amsterdam has both a unique heritage and a tendency for innovation; using a complex system of dikes, barriers, and levees to protect the population from the ever-present threat of floods.<\/p>\n<p>Walking on these city streets today doesn\u2019t feel futuristic; elegant Victorian facades and cobblestoned streets give the sense of walking inside an artifact. It is an urban feel that the city council\u2019s smart city division hopes to preserve as they integrate the sensors needed to take the city into the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>These sensors provide the data that feeds the digital infrastructure of the smart city, fueling the analytics process that ultimately feeds back to urban development.<\/p>\n<p>But embedding such sensors into historic water pipes, electric lines, traffic signals, and roads can be as complex as brain surgery in a place like Amsterdam. It can put the city on lockdown while the procedures take place, interrupting the city\u2019s daily life and quite possibly altering its character forever.<\/p>\n<p>To get around this, Amsterdam relies on a different source of fuel for its smart city engine: apps. The Apps for Amsterdam initiative was designed to challenge developers to build applications that contribute information to a public pool of data and keep citizens informed on a range of issues\u2014from air quality to restaurant sanitation and threats to public safety.<\/p>\n<p>The<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ad.nl\/binnenland\/landelijke-test-met-appende-wijkagenten-in-twente~a1a04c7f\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>Mijnbuur<\/span><\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>app\u2014which translates as MyNeighbour\u2014is one such app that adds a smart element to neighborhood WhatsApp groups. This allows concerned residents to share intel on local issues while having the option of inviting city officials and even police officers into the conversation to tackle more serious problems.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.verbeterdebuurt.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>Verbeterdebuurt<\/span><\/a>, or Improvedneighborhood, allows citizens to suggest changes and highlight problems with the city by snapping a photo with GPS metadata and sending it straight to the authorities.<\/p>\n<p>While using applications to generate data can skirt the difficulties of implementing new digital infrastructure, the processing and storage of this data still raise questions that current systems can\u2019t always find an answer to.<\/p>\n<p>Most pertinently \u2013 when data is generated from a private application and fed back to a government source, who can take ownership of this data, and who should be able to use it to advance their agenda?<\/p>\n<p>Many cities that retain data from smart city projects require the companies doing the data collection to subsequently destroy it in line with<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cordis.europa.eu\/news\/rcn\/130305\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>GDPR principles<\/span><\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>of data minimization. But as this data drives the development of the smart city, destroying it can be counterproductive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven simple infrastructure like a streetlight, which historically might have been built by the private sector and funded by the public, introduces new issues when it\u2019s smart. Add WiFi access points and systems to harvest anonymize data, and you raise new private\/public issues.\u201d says expert<span>\u00a0<\/span><span>Gary Sharkey<\/span>, who is helping PwC develop a smart city strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Smart cities built on greenfield sites can create a structure to manage this data from the ground up. If these new cities are in more authoritarian regimes or less privacy-conscious jurisdictions \u2013 like China \u2013 then there is little incentive for them to ensure that data is managed appropriately.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, historic cities bound by the democratic process are faced with the challenge of building a digital infrastructure that allows data to be collected and shared as openly and efficiently as possible.<\/p>\n<p>This is all while still giving citizens the maximum possible control over their personal data in accordance with GDPR principles such as privacy by design, data portability and the right to be forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>Smart cities company Sharkey suggests that cities upgrading their digital infrastructure need to first get their \u201cdata house in order,\u201d pointing to efforts by the European Union to create new vehicles that bridge the public and private sector to effectively manage data.<\/p>\n<p>These vehicles include an \u2018operating system for smart cities\u2018<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiware.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>FIWARE<\/span><\/a>, which claims to be a \u201cshared set of mechanisms to develop smart city solutions.\u201d This software is designed to slot in with city level governance and break data down into silos that prevent the mixing of public and private data but also provide a holistic picture of city events.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of this software is a novel idea known as the data marketplace, which is effectively the 21st century equivalent of the market square. It enables the transacting of both sensitive private data, at a cost, and the sharing of public open-source data that is made freely available\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journal.binarydistrict.com\/the-danger-of-the-digital-divide-how-smart-are-the-smart-city-initiatives\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>for everyone\u2019s benefit<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This relies on big data, cloud computing,\u00a0 and smart city technology to create an interface that enables the convenient buying and selling of data.<\/p>\n<p>And it is this convergence of technologies \u2013 combined with human ingenuity and historical sensitivity \u2013 that can pull ancient cities into the 21st century without damaging our architectural legacy, or infringing on our innate rights to privacy.<\/p>",

I love that I\u2019m no longer tethered to my desk when I need a beverage refill, or a quick bite \u2014 or perhaps a quick run to the toilet (I know this isn\u2019t the type of TMI you signed up for when you clicked on this post, but I\u2019m speaking truth here, you\u00a0know you\u2019ve been there).<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why you pay extra for wireless. Well, usually, but not today.

Average of the models in black with model range in grey compared to observational temperature records from NASA, NOAA, HadCRUT, Cowtan and Way, and Berkeley Earth. Carbon Brief, CC BY<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p><\/figure><p>The shift in public opinion means that undermining the science will increasingly have little or no effect. So climate change deniers are switching to new tactics. One of Britain\u2019s leading deniers, Nigel Lawson, the former UK chancellor, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/environment\/global-warming-climate-change-sceptic-nigel-lawson-real-humans-causing-a7307456.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">now agrees that humans are causing climate change<\/a>, despite having founded the skeptic Global Warming Policy Foundation in 2009.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thegwpf.org\/who-we-are\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">It says<\/a> it is \u201copen-minded on the contested science of global warming, [but] is deeply concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated.\u201d In other words, climate change is now about the cost,\u00a0not\u00a0science.<\/p>\n<h2>Economic denial<\/h2>\n<p>The idea that climate change is too expensive to fix is a more subtle form of climate denial. Economists, however, suggest we could fix climate change now by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatecentral.org\/news\/climate-economists-stern-review-20827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">spending 1 percent of world GDP<\/a>. Perhaps even less if the cost savings from improved <a href=\"https:\/\/newclimateeconomy.report\/2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">human health and expansion of the global green economy<\/a> are taken into account. But if we don\u2019t act now, by 2050 it could cost over 20 percent of world GDP.<\/p>\n<p>We should also remember that in 2018 the world generated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2019\/09\/fifteen-countries-represent-three-quarters-total-gdp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$86,000,000,000,000 and every year this World GDP grows by 3.5 percent<\/a>. So setting aside just 1 percent to deal with climate change would make little overall difference and would save the world a huge amount of money. What the climate change deniers also forget to tell you is that they are protecting a fossil fuel industry that receives <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/WP\/Issues\/2019\/05\/02\/Global-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Remain-Large-An-Update-Based-on-Country-Level-Estimates-46509\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$5.2 trillion<\/a> in annual subsidies \u2013 which includes subsidized supply costs, tax breaks and environmental costs. This amounts to 6 percent of world GDP.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/WP\/Issues\/2019\/05\/02\/Global-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Remain-Large-An-Update-Based-on-Country-Level-Estimates-46509\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">International Monetary Fund estimates<\/a> that efficient fossil fuel pricing would lower global carbon emissions by 28 percent, fossil fuel air pollution deaths by 46 percent, and increase government revenue by 3.8 percent of the country\u2019s GDP.<\/p>\n<h2>Humanitarian denial<\/h2>\n<p>Climate change deniers also argue that climate change is good for us. They suggest longer, warmer summers in the temperate zone will make farming more productive. These gains, however, are often offset by the drier summers and increased the frequency of heatwaves in those same areas. For example, the 2010 \u201cMoscow\u201d heatwave <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3984022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">killed 11,000 people<\/a>, devastated the <a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/332\/6026\/220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Russian wheat harvest<\/a> and increased global food prices.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304069\/original\/file-20191127-112484-1oqe1pq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304069\/original\/file-20191127-112484-1oqe1pq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304069\/original\/file-20191127-112484-1oqe1pq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304069\/original\/file-20191127-112484-1oqe1pq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304069\/original\/file-20191127-112484-1oqe1pq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=335&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304069\/original\/file-20191127-112484-1oqe1pq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=421&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304069\/original\/file-20191127-112484-1oqe1pq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=421&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304069\/original\/file-20191127-112484-1oqe1pq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=421&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><\/a><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F07%2F5-corrupt-reasons-why-people-deny-the-climate-crisis%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Geographical zones of the world.

This is indeed true and the <a href=\"https:\/\/sos.noaa.gov\/datasets\/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">land biosphere has been absorbing about a quarter<\/a> of our carbon dioxide pollution every year. Another <a href=\"https:\/\/sos.noaa.gov\/datasets\/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">quarter of our emissions is absorbed by the oceans<\/a>. But losing massive areas of natural vegetation through deforestation and changes in land use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/ask-the-experts-does-rising-co2-benefit-plants1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">completely nullifies this minor fertilization effect<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Climate change deniers will tell you that more people die of the cold than heat, so warmer winters will be a good thing. This is deeply misleading. Vulnerable people die of the cold because of poor housing and not being able to afford to heat their homes. Society, not climate, kills them.<\/p>\n<p>This argument is also factually incorrect. In the US, for example, heat-related deaths are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/hazstat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">four times higher than cold-related ones<\/a>. This may even be an underestimate as many heat-related deaths are recorded by cause of death such as heart failure, stroke, or respiratory failure, all of which are exacerbated by excessive heat.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303174\/original\/file-20191122-74542-18pg9xy.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303174\/original\/file-20191122-74542-18pg9xy.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303174\/original\/file-20191122-74542-18pg9xy.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=410&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303174\/original\/file-20191122-74542-18pg9xy.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=410&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303174\/original\/file-20191122-74542-18pg9xy.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=410&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303174\/original\/file-20191122-74542-18pg9xy.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=515&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303174\/original\/file-20191122-74542-18pg9xy.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=515&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/303174\/original\/file-20191122-74542-18pg9xy.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=515&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><\/a><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F07%2F5-corrupt-reasons-why-people-deny-the-climate-crisis%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: US weather fatalities for 2018 alongside the ten- and 30-year average.

But there are a few important caveats.<\/p>\n<p>For one, e-bikes are typically big and heavy; many city dwellers already forgo regular bikes because they take up too much space in a small apartment or they don\u2019t want to walk them up a flight of stairs. For another, you\u2019ll be even more paranoid about locking them up. You\u2019ll need at least two heavy-duty locks to protect your pricey purchase.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>That\u2019s where a folding bike like the <a href=\"https:\/\/oyama.com\/product\/cx-e8d-series-ii\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">$1,999 Oyama CX E8D Series II<\/a> comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Oyama is a Taiwanese company that\u2019s been making folding bikes for decades and entered the US market with e-bikes more recently. At 42 pounds, the E8D lighter than most full-size e-bikes, and can fold down into the size of a large suitcase. Its compact size means you can often bring it indoors to meetings and restaurants, instead of leaving it exposed to thieves and weather. And unlike many folding bikes at its price point that compromise on ride experience and functionality, the E8D\u2019s hardware makes it a pleasure to ride.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260489 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-3-of-9.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-3-of-9.jpg 1640w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-3-of-9-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-3-of-9-479x270.jpg 479w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-3-of-9-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-3-of-9-796x448.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-3-of-9-1592x897.jpg 1592w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-3-of-9-1200x675.jpg 1200w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>The E8D\u2019s rear hub 350W motor may not sound like much when there are plenty of full-size bikes hitting the 750W US federal limit, but it\u2019s actually a bit higher than the 250W motors you often see on folding models.<\/p>\n<p>That said, having recently tested the <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/08\/29\/review-the-1299-radrunner-is-part-cargo-e-bike-part-moped-and-all-fun\/\">Rad Power Bikes RadRunner<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/10\/31\/e-bike-review-the-juiced-bikes-crosscurrent-x-goes-28-mph-and-has-ridiculous-range\/\">Juiced Bikes CrossCurrent X<\/a> \u2013 both with 750W motors \u2013 I expected a big downgrade in performance. But in practice, I hardly noticed the difference in stop and go city traffic. The bike has eight levels of power and assist and felt positively zippy in its maximum power mode.<\/p>\n<p>Mind you, I\u2019m a 270lb rider, so power shouldn\u2019t be a concern for most users. It also speaks to the stability of the frame, that I didn\u2019t notice any flexing or otherwise feel like the bike was compromised by its heavy load.<\/p>\n<p>The relatively small, 20 x 2 tires likely help here. Smaller tires generally mean less inertia, equating to slightly faster acceleration at the expense of less stability. More important is the bike\u2018s 42lb weight. By comparison, the RadRunner and CCX are 65 pounds.<\/p>\n<p>Like the CCX, the E8D has another trick up its sleeve: a torque sensor. Most e-bikes use a cadence sensor that provides a fixed boost depending on your assist level; it\u2019s especially hard to find anything else on a folding bike. A torque sensor, on the other hand, adjusts power delivery depending on how<span>\u00a0<\/span><em>hard<\/em>\u00a0you\u2019re pedaling. It knows that you need more help going uphill than downhill, for instance, and both feels nicer and saves battery.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260493 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-7-of-9.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-7-of-9.jpg 1640w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-7-of-9-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-7-of-9-479x270.jpg 479w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-7-of-9-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-7-of-9-796x448.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-7-of-9-1592x897.jpg 1592w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-7-of-9-1200x675.jpg 1200w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the E8D\u2019s torque sensor might actually be the smoothest power delivery of any e-bike I\u2019ve tried to date, reacting instantly to my pedaling without any semblance of the jerkiness I sometimes experience on other bikes. Combine that with whisper-quiet operation, and you can hardly tell there\u2019s a motor at work. Well, other than the fact you\u2019re able to speed up hills like nobody\u2019s business. It\u2019s an immensely satisfying ride.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of speed, the E8D is limited to 20mph by default, which is good enough for most\u00a0people. You can, however, set a different maximum speed in the display to meet local ordinances. New York is set to establish a 25mph speed limit for e-bikes, so that\u2019s what I set it to on the E8D.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, that\u2019s about as fast as you\u2019ll be able to go anyway, as I found the gearing to not be much help beyond 24 miles per hour. Also keep in mind the E8D has no throttle, if that\u2019s important to you. You\u2019ll be doing at least some pedaling all the way.<\/p>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth the ride felt on rough city roads despite a lack of suspension. Oyama\u2018s site says the bikes comes with Schwalbe Big Apple tires, but mine came with chunky 20 x 2.125 Kenda tires. Schwalbe is a more reputable brand, but the Kendas do a good job of absorbing bumps in the road.<\/p>\n<p>The compact tires and narrow handlebars also make for superior maneuverability in city traffic, making it easier to squeeze between that cabbie yelling at a pedestrian.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image-1260491 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1042\" height=\"587\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1042px) 100vw, 1042px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-5-of-9.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-5-of-9.jpg 1640w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-5-of-9-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-5-of-9-479x270.jpg 479w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-5-of-9-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-5-of-9-796x448.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-5-of-9-1592x897.jpg 1592w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-5-of-9-1200x675.jpg 1200w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fplugged%2F2019%2F12%2F06%2Foyama-e8d-ii-review-this-folding-e-bike-gets-almost-everything-right%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: The LCD display allows you to adjust a myriad of settings\" data-title=\"Share The LCD display allows you to adjust a myriad of settings on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share The LCD display allows you to adjust a myriad of settings on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>The LCD display allows you to adjust a myriad of settings<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The E8D also has hydraulic disc brakes, relatively rare on folding bikes, allowing it to\u00a0brake like a champ. And the sturdy rear rack meant I didn\u2019t worry about loading the bike with panniers full of groceries.<\/p>\n<p>Less thoughtful is the choice of seat: I found the stock saddle to be awful, and I promptly replaced it with a Selle Royale Scientia. And while the folding pedals are a nice touch for compactness, they flexed a bit too much for my liking (of course, that\u2019s contingent on your weight).<\/p>\n<p>Despite those caveats, the E8D feels like a great bike before we even get to the folding capabilities. It takes less than 30 seconds to fold, and at its most compact, the E8D measures roughly 33 x 25 x 17 inches. It\u2019s not the smallest or most elegant folding 20-inch bike I\u2019ve seen; the GoCycle GX I recently tested folds a bit thinner and much more cleanly, but it\u2019s small enough to tuck away in a closet or under a desk.<\/p>\n<p>There are some clever touches here too. The folding mechanism uses a double latch for added security, and the seat post doubles as a stand to keep the bike upright once set to its lowest position. I was also told it comes with a velcro strap to hold the two sides together while wheeling the bike around in its folded position. My test unit did not, so I just used a bungee instead.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image-1260488 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"834\" height=\"834\" sizes=\"(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9.jpg 1640w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-96x96.jpg 96w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-210x210.jpg 210w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-270x270.jpg 270w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-135x135.jpg 135w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-796x796.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-1592x1592.jpg 1592w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-192x192.jpg 192w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-1472x1472.jpg 1472w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-1104x1104.jpg 1104w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-912x912.jpg 912w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-550x550.jpg 550w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-470x470.jpg 470w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-1-of-9-1200x1200.jpg 1200w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fplugged%2F2019%2F12%2F06%2Foyama-e8d-ii-review-this-folding-e-bike-gets-almost-everything-right%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: It\u2019s not the most elegant folding mechanism, but it\u2019s fast and gets the job done.\" data-title=\"Share It\u2019s not the most elegant folding mechanism, but it\u2019s fast and gets the job done. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share It\u2019s not the most elegant folding mechanism, but it\u2019s fast and gets the job done. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>It\u2019s not the most elegant folding mechanism, but it\u2019s fast and gets the job done.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>There are several subtle benefits to a folding bike I didn\u2019t realize until I started testing them. When I had a meeting, I could generally bring the bike inside the venue. If I\u2019m visiting a friend, the bike\u2018s small enough to bring inside without being obnoxious.<\/p>\n<p>While have to pay a fee to bring a non-folding bike on New York\u2019s state\u2019s Metro-North railroad, and are confined to off-peak hours and specific areas. Folding bikes are free and can go basically anywhere you want.<\/p>\n<p>If a restaurant is large or empty enough, they might let you bring the bike inside, saving you the hassle and paranoia of locking up. Even locking up is easier: if you have a chain or folding lock, you can fold the bike and loop the lock through both wheels and the frame in one go \u2013 perfect for brief stops.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, if your battery runs out and\/or you don\u2019t feel like riding the rest of the way home, the E8D will fit in the trunk of most cars. At one point I had some knee pain and decided to drive home using a local carshare service; I managed to squeeze the E8D into the tiny cargo area of a Smart ForTwo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image-1260490 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1082\" height=\"610\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1082px) 100vw, 1082px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-4-of-9.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-4-of-9.jpg 1640w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-4-of-9-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-4-of-9-479x270.jpg 479w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-4-of-9-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-4-of-9-796x448.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-4-of-9-1592x897.jpg 1592w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Oyama-CX-E8D-Series-II-4-of-9-1200x675.jpg 1200w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fplugged%2F2019%2F12%2F06%2Foyama-e8d-ii-review-this-folding-e-bike-gets-almost-everything-right%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: The E8D\u2019s battery is hidden inside the frame, but you can access a charging port even when the battery is inside the bike.

To sum them up:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I\u2019ve been spoiled by the 40-60 miles I can achieve with the 1000 watt-hour battery on the CCX. By comparison, the removable 362 Wh battery on the E8D \u2013 hidden within the frame and accessible when folded \u2013 gets me about 15-20 miles. Your mileage may vary depending on our weight, and keep in mind the E8D is relatively light so it\u2019s easier to ride back home unpowered once the battery does run out.<\/li>\n<li>Oyama needs some serious work on its website. I couldn\u2019t find folded dimensions\u00a0or range information. You know, two pretty important things for a folding e-bike.<\/li>\n<li>I can\u2019t find anywhere to buy official extra parts online. They are available neither on Oyama\u2019s site or with the few dealers online, and local dealers are far apart.

This comes a full year-and-a-half after the scandal originally broke and after Cambridge Analytica is no more, but hey\u2026 better late than never, right?<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Cambridge Analytica ignited a firestorm when it came to light it\u2019d used Facebook user information to help compile voter profiles. Said Facebook user information was harvested by former professor Aleksandr Kogan via a \u201cresearch app\u201d without said users\u2019 consent. That\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/facebook\/2018\/03\/21\/facebook-and-cambridge-analytica-heres-what-you-need-to-know\/\">the short version<\/a> anyway.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>This turned into a big debacle for Facebook when it came to light that the company new Cambridge Analytica had the data and didn\u2019t make much of an effort to ensure it was secure or deleted. Again, that\u2019s putting it as simply as possible \u2014 only because this turned to be just the biggest of a number of data leaks Facebook had in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>The FTC filed <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/facebook\/2019\/07\/25\/ftc-sues-now-bankrupt-cambridge-analytica-over-deceptive-practices\/\">a complaint against CA in July<\/a>, and today unanimously decided the company\u2019s practices qualified as deceptive. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2019\/12\/ftc-issues-opinion-order-against-cambridge-analytica-deceiving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Specifically, it said<\/a>: \u201c<span>The Federal Trade Commission issued an Opinion finding that the data analytics and consulting company Cambridge Analytica, LLC engaged in deceptive practices to harvest personal information from tens of millions of Facebook users for voter profiling and targeting.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The decision doesn\u2019t mean much at this point, considering Cambridge Analytica <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/socialmedia\/2018\/05\/02\/dogged-by-facebook-scandal-cambridge-analytica-closes-its-doors\/\">went bankrupt<\/a> and folded not too long after the scandal broke. The final order that prohibits the company from participating in privacy policy decisions and \u201c<span>to continue to apply Privacy Shield protections to personal information it collected while participating in the program (or to provide other protections authorized by law), or return or delete the information\u201d obviously can\u2019t be followed anymore.<\/span> The FTC added that \u201c<span>Cambridge Analytica, which filed for bankruptcy in 2018, did not respond to the complaint, or to a motion submitted for summary judgment of the allegations\u201d which\u2026 yeah, I can see why they wouldn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But still, any chance to further dump on the Cambridge Analytica garbage fire is one not to be passed up. The FTC also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2019\/07\/ftc-sues-cambridge-analytica-settles-former-ceo-app-developer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">said in June<\/a> that it\u2019d restricted the business of both Kogan and CA CEO Alexander Nix, and ordered them both to destroy any information they might still have.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, meanwhile, was <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/facebook\/2019\/07\/24\/facebook-gets-away-with-5b-ftc-fine-for-leaking-your-data\/\">ordered in July<\/a> to pay a $5 billion fine for both CA and its many, many other data leaks.<\/p>",

Key takeaways suggest the PRC spends much less than the US on \u2018military\u2018 and \u2018defense\u2018 AI.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a hot take: All AI is military AI.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Let\u2019s start with the study. You can read it <a href=\"https:\/\/cset.georgetown.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chinese-Public-AI-RD-Spending-Provisional-Findings-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>, but to briefly sum up, the authors write:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We assess with low to moderate confidence that China\u2019s public investment in AI R&amp;D was on the order of a few billion dollars in 2018. With higher confidence, we assess that China\u2019s government is not investing tens of billions of dollars annually in AI R&amp;D, as some have suggested.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers at CSET had a near-impossible job set out before them. The public discourse on China\u2018s spending is largely based on speculation. As you can imagine, the PRC doesn\u2019t release information about its government\u00a0spending.<\/p>\n<p>CSET takes great pains \u2013 over dozens of paragraphs \u2013 to point out that there isn\u2019t enough data available on China\u2018s AI spending to come to any real conclusions. Here the researchers point out that these are estimates:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Given the pervasive uncertainties and assumptions in our analysis, we urge readers not to draw anything from these figures other than rough orders of magnitude.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>However, they also point out that their study\u2019s purpose was to research previous estimates and update with any new information, thus CSET\u2019s guesses are far more educated:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We believe it is highly unlikely that China is investing tens of billions of dollars per year in AI R&amp;D, as other sources suggest. Although our findings and assumptions are tentative, inferring tens of billions of dollars in annual R&amp;D spending from publicly available data would require much more extreme assumptions.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So what can we take away from this knowledge? We thought China was spending tens of billions of dollars per a year on military AI, so we were scared that the PRC was going to become <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2018\/07\/30\/china-set-to-leapfrog-us-in-the-ai-race\/\">the supreme AI power<\/a> and dominate the world by 2030. Now that we can better assume it isn\u2019t wildly outspending the US on defense-oriented R&amp;D, should we all sleep better at night?<\/p>\n<p>No. What we can glean about China\u2019s AI program from financial breadcrumbs and common sense won\u2019t change the basic fact that there\u2019s no such thing as non-military AI.<\/p>\n<p>Does anyone actually believe that researchers like Andrew Ng and Ian Goodfellow developed deep learning techniques because they were driven by a lifelong passion to create an AI that could tell the difference between a cat and a dog? No, that\u2019s preposterous. The big picture, whether it\u2019s general AI or something else, has nothing to do with trivial problems.<\/p>\n<p>The US calls everything even slightly related to the military \u201cdefense spending\u201d because it\u2019s pretty easy for a Republican-lead US government to get money for defense. The same tech that powers the CBP\u2019s facial recognition systems also powers Amazon\u2019s Ring cameras.<\/p>\n<p>China can call it whatever it wants to \u2013 but the tech powering Alibaba\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2017\/11\/13\/alibabas-ai-is-the-blueprint-for-brick-and-mortar-stores-of-the-future\/\">fashion AI<\/a> can be adapted to power <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2017\/07\/27\/russia-is-developing-ai-missiles-to-dominate-the-new-arms-race\/\">missile targeting systems<\/a> as easy as it can to predict whether your outfit is trendy or not.<\/p>\n<p>Whether certain funds were earmarked for military, defense, education, or civilian R&amp;D are irrellevent because artificial intelligence isn\u2019t a product-based technology like hover tanks or railguns, it\u2019s a science-based one like atomic bombs or electricity. Once we figure something out, the genie\u2019s out of the bottle.<\/p>\n<p>Is China spending less money on military AI than we previously assumed? It doesn\u2019t matter. According to the CSET study,\u00a0China is\u00a0probably outspending the US on <em>overall<\/em> AI research (despite its GDP being roughly 40 percent lower). That seems like the more important\u00a0takeaway.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/614842\/china-us-ai-military-spending\/?utm_source=newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_algorithm.unpaid.engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>H\/t: Karen Hao, Tech Review<\/em><\/a><\/p>",

And damned if it doesn\u2019t suit it perfectly.<\/p>\n<p>One of the <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/cars\/2019\/11\/22\/cybertruck-looks-like-internet\/\">most common jokes<\/a> at the expense of the Cybertruck was that it looked like a polygonal model from a 64-bit console of choice. It was compared to everything from Pok\u00e9mon to Lara Croft\u2019s bust line \u2014 but my favorites were probably the Photoshop jobs that put the car into old-school racing games like\u00a0<em>Cruisin\u2019 World<\/em>. Twitter is a riot when it\u2019s got something this cool to make fun of.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>It was only a matter of time before someone took it one step further, and here\u2019s that step:<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wQ3tnsMlkBI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The truck is a tiny bit more pixelated than the real vehicle, but honestly not by much. You can still read its distinctive silhouette pretty plainly.<\/p>\n<p>The modder, who goes by the handle \u201cGraslu00,\u201d not only added the Cybertruck to the game, they also somehow managed to mod Elon Musk into the game, putting his face on an NPC body. No offense intended to Musk, but I can\u2019t help but think his face fits this game just as well as the Cybertruck does. It\u2019s only slightly nightmarish. There\u2019s even a bit of dialogue where Bond question why Musk is giving him a Cybertruck, and Musk responds that he wants to see fossil fueled cars and those who drive them \u2014 the villainous General Ourumov included \u2014 put out of commission.<\/p>\n<p>I had no idea Elon was so cutthroat, but somehow I\u2019m not surprised either. Given that the model for the Cybertruck replaces the tank, this truck is also packing some heavy ordinance, which I would also not be entirely surprised to find secretly hidden somewhere in the real deal.<\/p>\n<p>You can download the mod for an N64 ROM <a href=\"http:\/\/n64vault.com\/ge-for-fun:cybertruck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is at it again, this time with a bold claim about an iPhone that\u2019s nearly two years away. According to the generally accurate Kuo, at least one variant of the 2021 iPhone will have no ports whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>While most of us assumed Apple would make the switch to USB-C at some point, it now seems like this might not be the case. According to Kuo, the 2021 iPhone will \u201cprovide the completely wireless experience\u201d (via <em><a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2019\/12\/05\/kuo-iphone-2020-and-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">9to50Mac<\/a><\/em>). Kuo expects the charging port will be removed from the flagship model first. Because of course, power users are the people who love getting features removed.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>We\u2019ve long speculated about a port-free iPhone, but didn\u2019t think it would arrive quite so soon considering the popularity of USB-C and its prominent use among Apple\u2019s tablets and Laptops. It seems like one of those things that Jony Ive would have advocated, given his dream of an iPhone that looked like \u2018a single sheet of glass,\u2019 but we\u2019re not sure how much influence his design ideals hold now that he\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apple\/2019\/06\/27\/chief-design-officer-jony-ive-is-leaving-apple\/\">left the company<\/a>\u00a0and will consult from his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/11\/28\/20986838\/jony-ive-last-day-apple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">new design firm<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re also not sure how that would play out in practice. While wireless charging can be convenient, it\u2019s also pretty much useless in its current form if you want to actually use the phone while charging. Perhaps the company will have some sort of grip attachment, or it thinks its new phone will have enough battery that they only need to be charged overnight. Or perhaps it\u2019s figured out how to transmit wireless electricity from a distance effectively \u2013 a man can dream.<\/p>\n<p>Kuo has also updated his prediction on other upcoming Apple devices. He still believe a new iPhone SE 2 will arrive in early 2020, shaped like an 4.7-inch iPhone 8 but with better internals.<\/p>\n<p>Later in the year, Apple will release four phones, including two 6.1-inch models, a 6.7-inch model, and a new, smaller 5.4-inch one. If the rumors pan out, it\u2019ll be nice to see the company trending towards smaller phones, not bigger ones. The two lower end models will still have dual cameras, while the high end models will have three and an extra time-of-flight sensor for depth-sensing purposes.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, Kuo believes Apple will release an iPhone SE 2 Plus in 2021 with a 5.5-inch or 6.1 display. It sounds like the company has a busy few years ahead.<\/p><p><i>For more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/plugged\">Twitter<\/a> and\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/flipboard.com\/@thenextweb\/plugged-54nihknvy\">Flipboard<\/a>.\n            <\/i><\/p>",

The number of dislikes is rocketing up \u2013 the dislike ratio is rapidly approaching last year\u2019s, and it\u2019s been less than 6 hours \u2013 while the comments are unerringly critical. It feels as though YouTube is playing it way too safe after the disaster that was Rewind 2018 \u2014 almost to the point of pettishness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2lAe1cqCOXo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Compared with Rewinds of years past, this one \u2014 titled \u201cFor the Record\u201d \u2014 is almost depressingly sedate. It\u2019s basically a listicle in which YouTube rattles off the most-viewed or most-liked videos of the year and other statistics. There isn\u2019t even any narration. Compare it to the original Rewind from 2011, which at least had Rebecca Black throwing in some color commentary. Rewind 2019 is just a few brief, epileptic clips from each of the videos spliced together with some music.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a reason for this. You may remember Rewind 2018 was more than a little controversial. Even the content creators who were in the video didn\u2019t seem that keen on it, and the community resoundingly rejected it. It\u2019s currently the most-disliked YouTube video of all time, and you can find any number of reaction videos ripping it to shreds.<\/p>\n<p>There were a multitude of complaints. The biggest ones were that many of the creators were not actually that popular, many controversial stars were shafted because of said controversies (it\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen Pewdiepie in one of these in a couple of years), and that it tried to court popular opinion by including people who weren\u2019t YouTubers, such as Ninja and Will Smith. Most reactions came down to a single word: \u201cCringe.\u201d Even YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki <a href=\"https:\/\/youtube-creators.googleblog.com\/2019\/02\/youtube-in-2019-looking-back-and-moving.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">said her children used that word<\/a> to describe it to her.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YbJOTdZBX1g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>So, knowing that, it\u2019s probably not a surprise that Rewind 2019 comes across like a gigantic pout from YouTube. It even opens with the words: \u201cIn 2018, we made something you didn\u2019t like. So in 2019, let\u2019s see what you DID like. Because you\u2019re better at this than we are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I know sometimes tone gets skewed in plain text \u2014 it\u2019s hard to put sincerity in white text on a black background. But come on, how can you interpret that as anything other than salty AF? And that is probably why the YouTube community isn\u2019t reacting to this one much better than it did to the last one. While the like-to-dislike ratio isn\u2019t quite as disproportionate as it was before, but it\u2019s still pretty clear the majority of viewers aren\u2019t digging YouTube\u2019s vibe with this video.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s something to be said for YouTube Rewind as a celebration of the communities and trends that make it so diverse and watchable, which many felt 2018 failed to do. I\u2019m on board with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Marques Brownlee\u2019s explanation<\/a> that Google was using Rewind 2018 as a tool to attract advertisers, and his assessment that it\u2019s a degradation that started many Rewinds ago.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to see how all of the trends shake out, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/rewind.youtube\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the Rewind site<\/a>.<\/p>",

Incredible. I know we\u2019re out here selling plasma and sperm just to pay our cell phone bills up long enough to post the next GoFundMe request to cover our insulin costs, but people: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/personalfinance\/2015\/03\/15\/credit-dotcom-dangerous-identity-theft\/70136996\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">don\u2019t sell your identities<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, let\u2019s not lose sight of the big picture here. We\u2019re not just talking about identity theft, it\u2019s also a matter of everyday vigilance. As the survey\u2019s authors write:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Many hesitate at the idea of \u201cselling\u201d their data, but we give our data away every day. Besides shopping programs, we use our email addresses to sign into apps and software all the time. Over 40% of respondents refused to sell their email addresses, but many don\u2019t bat an eye when websites ask someone to create an account by signing in with their email.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Other insights gleaned from the survey were that, among those who\u2019d consider selling data, people believed the going rate for a social security number should be about $10,000 US. That sounds about right, but it\u2019s actually $9,998 too high.<\/p>\n<p>There aren\u2019t any black market sales reps standing by to talk you through selling your identity. Someone\u2019s just going to swipe it from a list of hacked documents and sell it along with 50,000 others at a premium discount to a company who uses them in bulk.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s why the fact that the report says among those surveyed, people in their 20s\u00a0were <em>most<\/em> likely to sell their data, is terrifying. The most tech-savvy generation may also be the least secure one \u2014 this doesn\u2019t bode well.

Now that it\u2019s added the Quest, it supports every major headset including Rift, Rift S, Index, and Windows Mixed Media devices.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Infinity is the best bargain in VR gaming thanks to its diverse lineup. At launch <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/04\/05\/viveport-infinity-is-good-heres-how-htc-can-make-it-great\/\">my biggest complaint<\/a> was that the VR field only had a handful of hit AAA titles and the majority of them weren\u2019t available on Infinity.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s since changed. <em>Arizona Sunshine<\/em>, <em>Superhot<\/em>, and <em>Fruit Ninja VR<\/em> are all there along with dozens of other premium titles. You still won\u2019t find <em>Beat Saber<\/em> on Inifnity, but if you own an Oculus Quest you probably already have that title.<\/p>\n<p>And, ironically, after the Quest\u2019s launch <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/07\/09\/tnws-mid-2019-guide-to-virtual-reality-hardware\/\">I lamented<\/a> the fact that it was a brilliant headset that would leave me wishing it could play <i>all<\/i><span> the games I wanted. That\u2019s also changed. With the launch of the Oculus Link beta, Quest owners now have the ability to tether their headsets to their PCs to play Rift games \u2014 something Viveport Infinity has a lot of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you have an Oculus Quest headset, a PC that <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/323910\/SteamVR_Performance_Test\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">can run VR software<\/a>, and the proper cable, all you need is a free trial to Viveport Infinity to get started. Here\u2019s the step-by-step instructions <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.vive.com\/us\/2019\/12\/05\/use-oculus-quest-link-beta-viveport-infinity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">from HTC<\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Oculus desktop app. *Make sure your Quest\u2019s firmware is updated to version 11.0 or greater<\/li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Unknown Sources to enable 3rd party sources<\/li>\n<li>Navigate to Beta and join the public test channel<\/li>\n<li>Go to Devices on the menu bar and add \u201cQuest\u201d as your headset<\/li>\n<li>Connect your Quest to your PC via USB-C cable<\/li>\n<li>Click \u201cEnable\u201d during the Oculus Link prompt in headset<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019re up-to-speed you need only download and install the Infinity software and you\u2019re ready to go. Keep in mind that Infinity is a subscription gaming service, not a streaming platform. You\u2019ll need to download the games you want to play \u2013 and there is a lot of compelling content here \u2013 so make sure you have space available.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll say it again: this is a really great combination. <span>With the holidays coming up, it\u2019s a great time to pick up an Oculus Quest. You might be tempted to go with the cheaper Go (which I adore), but it\u2019s not a gamer\u2019s headset. And wired headsets are going the way of the dodo. Now, for the first time, you don\u2019t have to choose between a wireless Oculus experience and Infinity\u2019s best-deal-in-VR platform. This is a great day for VR lovers. <\/span><\/p><p><i>For more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/plugged\">Twitter<\/a> and\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/flipboard.com\/@thenextweb\/plugged-54nihknvy\">Flipboard<\/a>.\n            <\/i><\/p>",

When the company offered me a crack at their newest seating option, the Kinn Chair, I didn\u2019t hesitate.<\/p>\n<p>Kinn is decidedly new but also familiar to anyone who has eyed Herman Miller\u2019s pricy Embody \u2014 a $1,300 technological marvel that can quickly shoot past $1,600 depending on the selected upgrades. What makes Embody special is its TPE spine, a collection of arms covered in rubberized mesh that mimics the movement of the human spine. When you twist to the left, for example, so does the chair.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260226 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"267\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/ezgif.com-crop.gif\" data-lazy=\"true\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Kinn offers the same sort of experience, but at $399. It\u2019s no Embody, spending $1,500-or-so on a chair doesn\u2019t really make sense for most people.<\/p>\n<p>After unboxing Kinn, what immediately struck me was the quality of the pieces. It\u2019s plastic in all areas except the base \u2014 which is heavy, and includes oversized wheels that glide perfectly on any surface I\u2019ve tried it on. But the plastic doesn\u2019t feel, nor look, cheap. I elected to go with the white model and \u201cNaked Grey\u201d TPE back, though there are half-a-dozen-or-so options that can provide a splash of color, or leave you with a more neutral-looking offering that you\u2019re probably used to. In hindsight, I wish I\u2019d had the courage to grab the green mesh back but I\u2019m not at all unhappy with the grey and white combo.<\/p>\n<p>Assembly was a snap, literally, with most items snapping together, held in place with screws and precise cuts. There\u2019s no guessing involved and even without the instructions \u2014 which were included, I\u2019m just instruction averse in most cases \u2014 I was able to assemble the chair within 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Once assembled, it\u2019s sturdy \u2014 weighing in at about 35 pounds. It\u2019s also devoid of the typical wobbles you\u2019ll find with poorly constructed offerings at cheaper price points.<\/p>\n<p>I finally did grab the instructions, but this time to understand the cranks, knobs, and handles on the underside of the chair. Aside from the TPE spine that moves as you do, there are a number of adjustments that help you to customize the armrests, back tilt angle, tension, seat height, and depth. It\u2019s a lot to figure out at first and I found it to be a constant work in progress for the first few days. Once it\u2019s dialed in though, it\u2019s incredibly comfortable, even for someone like me who spends eight-plus hours at his desk each day.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260214 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"264\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/Dec-05-2019-10-37-11.gif\" data-lazy=\"true\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve grown to love Kinn, but I didn\u2019t enjoy the chair at first. In fact, I found it to be quite uncomfortable. This was mostly due to my poor habits, however. I sat in strange positions (and repositioned myself constantly) that caused a lot of strain on the joints \u2014 the knees (I often sit with one foot tucked into or under my other thigh), neck, back, and shoulders. After a few days though, I found that my posture started to improve, as did the comfort level of the Kinn Chair. I can\u2019t stress this enough, but Kinn really is a chair designed for the \u201cproper\u201d seating position. If you can\u2019t adjust, it\u2019s best to look elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>For me though, the forced ergonomics proved to be beneficial. After two months of daily use, the proper seating position comes naturally now and I no longer have the aches and pains I\u2019d experienced my whole professional life.<\/p>\n<p>Is it as good as Herman Miller\u2019s Embody? No, but it\u2019s clear the inspiration Autonomous AI took from that design has paid off. At $399, the Kinn Chair is a no-brainer for anyone looking at an ergonomic option at this price point. As for me, I\u2019m still using it and I plan to continue doing so until something better comes along..<\/p><p><i>For more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/plugged\">Twitter<\/a> and\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/flipboard.com\/@thenextweb\/plugged-54nihknvy\">Flipboard<\/a>.\n            <\/i><\/p>",

        "content": "<p>Studio Ghibli, the legendary film studio that has been notoriously leery of digitally distributing its exceptional movies, will do just that later this month. The Tokyo studio\u2019s entire catalog will be available on major stores, including Amazon and Apple TV. It\u2019d previously inked an exclusive streaming deal with the upcoming HBO Max. So what does this mean for both the service and those who might be considering buying it?<\/p>\n<p>In October, <a href=\"https:\/\/pressroom.warnermediagroup.com\/na\/media-release\/hbo-max-acquires-us-streaming-rights-studio-ghibli-films?language_content_entity=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Warner Media revealed<\/a> it\u2019d acquired the exclusive US rights to stream Ghibli\u2019s films to its upcoming service, HBO Max. Needless to say, this was quite the feather in HBO\u2018s cap. Due to a distribution partnership with Disney, many assumed its Disney+ platform would be the most likely candidate to stream the movies if they ever became available. Instead HBO Max came out the surprise winner.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Before this was revealed, Studio Ghibli films simply weren\u2019t available on any kind of digital distribution service. You could watch them on their theatrical tours, or by watching a DVD, but you couldn\u2019t stream them or buy them on the likes of Amazon Prime or Apple Movies. According to North American distributor GKids, this is because the theatrical presentation is preferable. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2019\/10\/15\/20828843\/studio-ghibli-movies-miyazaki-streaming-netflix-disney-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a spokesperson told Polygon<\/a>: \u201c[Studio Ghibli]<span>\u00a0continue to believe that presentation is vital and particularly appreciate opportunities for audiences to experience the films together in a theatrical setting.\u201d<\/span> Now it seems it\u2019s going all-in on this 21st century conceit.<\/p>\n<p>So what impact is this likely to have on HBO Max, which is set to debut next spring? Not much, but it may impact what appeal it\u2019ll have for kids. Given the comparatively weighty library of Disney+, any blow to its kid-friendly lineup will put it at a disadvantage. As it is, HBO has a few other big names to buoy its appeal to younger kids: Sesame Street and Looney Tunes come to mind. But Studio Ghibli\u2019s films would have been a major attraction for both older kids and adults. It\u2019s a kick to HBO Max\u2019s tentpole \u2014 not a huge one, maybe, but a kick nonetheless.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m thrilled to finally be adding\u00a0<em>Spirited Away\u00a0<\/em>to my digital collection \u2014 and maybe secretly a little glad I wouldn\u2019t have to pay for HBO Max (yet\u00a0<em>another\u00a0<\/em>subscription) just for the privilege of not having to borrow from my little brother\u2019s extensive DVD collection. I wonder how many others might feel the same way?<\/p>\n<p>Studio Ghibli\u2019s films will be available <a href=\"https:\/\/gkids.com\/2019\/12\/02\/gkids-to-release-full-studio-ghibli-film-library-on-digital-transactional-platforms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">starting December 17<\/a> on all major platforms, including Apple TV and Amazon.

As commercial organizations become more and more pivotal in funding AI research labs, they can also influence the direction of their activities. For the moment, Companies like Google and Microsoft can tolerate bearing the financial costs of running AI research labs like DeepMind and OpenAI. But they also expect a return on investment in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is, both OpenAI and DeepMind pursue scientific projects such as<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2017\/05\/12\/what-is-narrow-general-and-super-artificial-intelligence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">artificial general intelligence (AGI)<\/a>, a goal that we have yet to understand, let alone achieve.

This will make their wealthy funders happy, it will be<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2019\/07\/22\/general-ai-driverless-cars-impossible\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">to detriment of AI research in general<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re very uncertain about the future of compute usage in AI systems, but it\u2019s difficult to be confident that the recent trend of a rapid increase in compute usage will stop, and we see many reasons that the trend could continue. Based on this analysis, we think policymakers should consider increasing funding for academic research into AI, as it\u2019s clear that some types of AI research are becoming more computationally intensive and therefore expensive,\u201d the OpenAI researchers write.<\/p>\n<h2>The carbon footprint of AI research<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"jetpack-lazy-image jetpack-lazy-image--handled wp-image-6017 size-full lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" alt=\"carbon emissions\" width=\"696\" height=\"355\" data-attachment-id=\"6017\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2019\/11\/25\/ai-research-neural-networks-compute-costs\/carbon-emissions\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?fit=4451%2C2273&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4451,2273\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"carbon emissions\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?fit=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?fit=696%2C355&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-loaded=\"1\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=696%2C355&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?w=4451&amp;ssl=1 4451w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=1024%2C523&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=768%2C392&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=1536%2C784&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=2048%2C1046&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=696%2C355&amp;ssl=1 696w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=1068%2C545&amp;ssl=1 1068w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=822%2C420&amp;ssl=1 822w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?resize=1920%2C980&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/bdtechtalks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/carbon-emissions.jpg?w=1392&amp;ssl=1 1392w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F05%2Fhow-the-bigger-is-better-mentality-is-damaging-ai-research%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: The compute resources required to train large AI models to consume huge amounts of energy, which creates a carbon emission problem.\" data-title=\"Share The compute resources required to train large AI models to consume huge amounts of energy, which creates a carbon emission problem. on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share The compute resources required to train large AI models to consume huge amounts of energy, which creates a carbon emission problem. on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"><\/i><\/a>The compute resources required to train large AI models to consume huge amounts of energy, which creates a carbon emission problem.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>According to<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1906.02243\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a paper<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, training a transformer AI model (often used in<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2018\/02\/20\/ai-machine-learning-nlg-nlp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">language-related tasks<\/a>) with 213 million parameters causes as much pollution as the entire lifetime of five vehicles.

Unlike neural networks, symbolic AI does not scale by increasing compute resources and data. It is also terrible at processing the messy, unstructured data of the real world. But it is terrific at knowledge representation and reasoning, two areas where neural networks lack sorely. Exploring hybrid AI approaches might open new pathways for creating more resource-efficient AI.<\/p>\n<p>There are several scientists who are interested in finding alternatives to the neural network\u2013only approaches.<span>\u00a0<\/span><em><a href=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2019\/10\/07\/rebooting-ai-gary-marcus-ernest-davis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Rebooting AI<\/a>,<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/em>a new book by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis, explores some of these concepts.<span>\u00a0<\/span><em>The Book of Why,<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/em>written by award-winning computer scientist Judea Pearl, also explores some of the fundamental problems that plague current AI systems.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the current excitement surrounding<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bdtechtalks.com\/2019\/02\/15\/what-is-deep-learning-neural-networks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">deep learning<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>has marginalized these conversations.

Well-lit streets will be marked in yellow, according to code hidden inside Maps beta release (v10.31.0) as spotted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xda-developers.com\/google-maps-prepares-lighting-layer-highlight-brightly-lit-streets-night-travel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">XDA Developers<\/a>.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Unfortunately, there are no images of the feature in action, as it\u2019s still under development. There\u2019s also no telling if the feature will be available worldwide, or limited strictly to specific regions. Another missing piece of information is how Google intends to source street lighting data, or keep the service up-to-date.<\/p>\n<p>This is hardly the first time the Big G has rolled out features designed to make it safer for users to navigate away from trouble. A couple of years back, the company embedded <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/google\/2017\/07\/25\/google-adds-sos-alerts-search-maps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SOS Alerts<\/a> straight into Maps in order to steer users away from natural disaster. Indeed, TNW staffers noticed Google marked the London Bridge as a \u201cdanger zone\u201d during <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk-news\/2019\/dec\/04\/london-bridge-attack-victims-died-after-being-stabbed-in-chest-inquest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">recent incidents<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Back in June, Maps introduced a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/8723647?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Stay Safer<\/a>\u201d feature in India which notified users if their driver has strayed away from the expected route.<\/p>\n<p>As with all APK teardown scoops, it\u2019s worth noting there\u2019s no guarantee this feature will ever see the light of day. If it does, though, we\u2019ll make sure to keep you appraised.<\/p>",

It is not clear what is defined as objectionable content.<\/li>\n<li>In second (and to an extent in third) point, Prasad suggests social media platforms have taken steps to curb fake news and put a limit on forwarding messages to other users. It\u2019s important to understand deepfake content is not always \u2018fake news\u2019. It could\u2019ve been created for entertainment purposes.

By reducing the brain\u2019s feel-good chemical known as dopamine \u2013 cutting back on things like food, sex, alcohol, social media, and technology \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/worklife\/article\/20191115-what-is-dopamine-fasting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">followers believe<\/a> that they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/shortcuts\/2019\/nov\/19\/dopamine-fasting-silicon-valley-avoid-stimulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">can \u201creset\u201d the brain<\/a> to be more effective and appreciate simple things more easily. Some even go so far as avoiding all social activities and even eye contact.<\/p>\n<p>The exercise, dubbed \u201cdopamine fasting\u201d by San Francisco psychologist <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DrSepah?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dr. Cameron Sepah<\/a>, is now getting increasing international attention. But what exactly is it? And does it work? As someone who studies the brain\u2019s reward system, I\u2019d like to share my knowledge with you.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter \u2013 a chemical messenger <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/explainer-what-is-dopamine-and-is-it-to-blame-for-our-addictions-51268\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">produced in the brain<\/a>. It is sent around the brain conveying signals related to functions such as motor control, memory, arousal and reward processing. For example, too little dopamine can result in disorders like <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/parkinsons-disease-scientists-find-the-earliest-roots-in-the-brain-119030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Parkinson\u2019s Disease<\/a>, involving symptoms of muscle rigidity, tremors and changes in speech and gait. One of the treatments for Parkinson\u2019s is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5345651\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the drug L-DOPA<\/a>, which can cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted into dopamine to help ease the symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>Dopamine is also important in the reward system in the brain. It is activated by primary rewards like food, sex, and drugs. Importantly, the brain\u2019s reward system can \u201clearn\u201d over time \u2013 cues in our environment that we associate with potential rewards can increase the activity of dopamine even in the absence of an actual reward. So just being in a sweet shop and thinking about sweets can activate our brain\u2019s dopamine.<\/p>\n<p>This expectation and anticipation of rewards are called the \u201cwanting\u201d in neuroscience language.

The idea of dopamine fasting is based on the knowledge that dopamine <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/newsletter_article\/how-addiction-hijacks-the-brain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">is involved<\/a> in unhealthy addictive behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>As described, dopamine underpins wanting. For instance, a drug addict may say they no longer want to take drugs. But when in certain places where drug-related cues are present, the brain\u2019s wanting system kicks in and addicts are overcome with strong urges to take the drug. Dopamine fasters believe that they can reduce desires and cravings for unhealthy and even unwanted behaviors by reducing dopamine.<\/p>\n<h2>Does it work?<\/h2>\n<p>First, we need to be clear, it is certainly not advisable, even if we could, to reduce the amount of dopamine in the brain as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/30446950\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">we need it for everyday normal functions<\/a>. Further, simply banning a particular reward, like social media, isn\u2019t going to reduce the levels of dopamine per se, but rather it can help reduce the stimulation of dopamine.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore it is possible to reduce the amount of dopamine activity. But the key to doing this is to reduce our exposure to the triggers associated with the rewards that initiate the wanting for the rewards in the first place. After all, it is these cues that initiate the craving and the desire to engage in behaviors that help us get the rewards. Thus just cutting out rewards doesn\u2019t necessarily stop the brain from making us crave them \u2013 activating dopamine.<\/p>\n<p>However, this would \u201creset the brain\u201d is not really correct \u2013 there is no way of even knowing what the baseline is. So from a neuroscience perspective, this is nonsense for the time being.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304243\/original\/file-20191128-178089-zf4jaj.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304243\/original\/file-20191128-178089-zf4jaj.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304243\/original\/file-20191128-178089-zf4jaj.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304243\/original\/file-20191128-178089-zf4jaj.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304243\/original\/file-20191128-178089-zf4jaj.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=552&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304243\/original\/file-20191128-178089-zf4jaj.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=552&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304243\/original\/file-20191128-178089-zf4jaj.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=552&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F05%2Fdopamine-fasting-an-expert-reviews-the-latest-craze-in-silicon-valley%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: Addicted?

Sam Wordley<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p><\/figure><p>If you find that you want to cut down on what you feel are unhealthy behaviors, such as spending too much time on social media or overeating, then you could start by reducing your exposure to the environmental cues that trigger the desire to carry out the unhealthy behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you go on your phone too much in the evenings when you are alone, try turning off the notifications sounds. This way dopamine is not being activated by the cues and therefore not signaling the urges to pick up the phone. And if you think you drink too much alcohol \u2013 ending up in bars with work colleagues most nights of the week \u2013 try to go somewhere else in the evenings, such as the cinema.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/how-to-tell-if-your-digital-addiction-is-ruining-your-life-127310\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">symptoms of unhealthy behaviors<\/a> are similar to the signs of substance abuse. These might include spending the majority of the time engaging in the behavior, continuing the behavior despite physical and\/or mental harm, having trouble cutting back despite wanting to stop and neglecting work, school or family. You may even experience symptoms of withdrawal (for example, depression, irritability) when trying to stop.<\/p>\n<p>In these instances, you may want to think about removing the cues that stimulate your dopamine neurons \u2013 a sort of dopamine fasting.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

I truly do.<\/p>\n<h2>The criticism<\/h2>\n<p>I think a lot of how useful or interesting Spotify\u2018s Wrapped breakdown, depends entirely on your listening habits. If the streaming service is your main music driver, and you only use it to play tracks you\u2019re actively listening to, it\u2019s quite insightful.<\/p>\n<p>But myself \u2014 and a lot of other people \u2014 either use Spotify in conjunction with other music services, and\/or as a focusing tool.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I still maintain a digital music library, so the majority of my active listening is done via files on my phone. Spotify, on the other hand, I use at work to drown out the noise of my bothersome co-workers (love you really) and to help me focus.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, this means that my Spotify Wrapped is consistently skewed towards ambient or beat-based music, which isn\u2019t really a representation of what I actually actively listen to.<\/p>\n<p>But \u2014 and this is the big question \u2014 does that actually matter?<\/p>\n<p>No. Not really.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.spotify.com\/wrapped\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Spotify\u2019s 2019 Wrapped<\/a> is just a bit of fun presented in an engaging way, it\u2019s a little something that helps us forget the endless drudgery of this terrible world.<\/p>\n<p>So, thanks, Spotify. You\u2019re okay with me.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>A new reports suggests that, contrary to what Microsoft employees have been saying for months, there are two Xbox models coming out in the next console generation. If the information is correct, Microsoft is making a cheaper and less-powerful console to compliment its powerhouse, Project Scarlett.<\/p>\n<p>The report comes <a href=\"https:\/\/kotaku.com\/sources-microsoft-is-still-planning-a-cheaper-disc-le-1840203823\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">from Kotaku\u2019s Jason Schreier<\/a>, who said a source confirmed that Microsoft still has the second console in the works. In contrast to the more powerful Scarlett, which is aimed at offering 4k gaming, this other console will be something more like 1440p and will operate without discs. Game developers have been asked to support both consoles. We don\u2019t know what the pricing will be \u2014 that\u2019ll have to wait until Microsoft makes whatever big reveal it plans for next year before the release.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Well don\u2019t I just feel personally bamboozled. For those of you who haven\u2019t had to keep up with this, the topic of whether a phantom second next-gen Xbox was in the works has been swirling around the Scarlett reveals for several months.<\/p>\n<p>To sum up, Microsoft is known to have had two consoles in the works in the lead-up to the Project Scarlett trailer. One was codenamed Anaconda, and the other was codenamed Lockhart. Anaconda is now Project Scarlett (please pick one codename and stick with it, Microsoft \u2014 this is already confusing enough).<\/p>\n<p>As for what happened to Lockhart, no one seems to know for sure. Xbox head Phil Spencer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com.au\/xbox-future-project-scarlett-phil-spencer-interview-2019-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">told Business Insider<\/a> that Scarlett is the only next-gen console the company is currently working on, and said his original use of the word \u201cconsoles\u201d was intended to include the discless version of Xbox One S and Scarlett \u2014 that\u2019s it. That\u2019s right, he\u2019s the one who started this by saying referring to multiple \u201cconsoles\u201d at E3 2018. \u201c<span>Last year we said consoles, and we\u2019ve shipped a console and we\u2019ve now detailed another console. I think that\u2019s plural\u2026\u00a0Technically that is plural,\u201d he said to BI\u2019s Ben Gilbert.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>He also <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/08\/16\/xbox-project-scarlett-no-streaming-console\/\">straight-up denied<\/a> later that the company was working on a streaming-only console, which <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7Hz7dn03OME\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Thurrott speculated<\/a> was <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2019\/07\/09\/microsoft-xcloud-console-drawing-board\/\">the rumored fate of Lockhart<\/a>. He also said Scarlett was the company\u2019s sole focus. If Schreier\u2019s intel is on the money, that means all these things were technically true \u2014 Microsoft\u00a0<em>isn\u2019t<\/em> working on a streaming-only platform, and it\u00a0<em>is\u00a0<\/em>only working on Scarlett. It\u2019s just that there might be two versions of Scarlett in the works.<\/p>\n<p>And to be fair, that was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thurrott.com\/games\/195395\/deciphering-xbox-scarlett-anaconda-anthem-danta-lockhart-maverick-and-roma#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the original rumor from Thurrott<\/a> in 2018, the one that started all this speculation in the first place. As Brad Sams put it: \u201c<span>Think of Lockhart as the successor to the Xbox One S, whereas Anaconda is the successor to the Xbox One X.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s just take our prophylactic grain of salt and assume that this is true. What\u2019s the advantage of this Lockhart console? For one thing, having a cheaper version never hurts \u2014 it\u2019s why Nintendo is cleaning up with the Switch Lite. One of the likely causes of the Xbox One\u2019s poor launch performance compared with the PS4 is that the former was $100 more expensive \u2014 and that\u2019s not just me saying it. Spencer himself said that in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/11\/14\/20965239\/xbox-project-scarlett-price-performance-ps5-phil-spencer-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">an interview with the Verge<\/a>. He also said Microsoft won\u2019t be making the same mistakes again, and \u201c<span>we will not be out of position on power or price.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So what do you think? Would you buy a cheaper next-gen Xbox? I\u2019m kind of curious to know.<\/p>",

In Musk\u2019s defense, he felt like he might be able to help and said his \u201cconscience\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/science\/2018\/07\/09\/watch-elon-musks-rescue-submarine-for-the-thai-soccer-boys-team-in-testing\/\">drove him to try<\/a>. Unsworth questioned whether Musk\u2019s help was needed \u2013 Musk doesn\u2019t have any experience with the dangers of cave diving, Unsworth is an expert \u2013 this prompted the now-deleted tweet in the screenshot above.<\/p>\n<p>Unsworth has since sued Musk for defamation, claiming damages over the billionaire celebrity\u2019s alleged insinuation that he sexually abuses children.<\/p>\n<p>According to a report from <a href=\"https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2019\/12\/elon-musk-trial-pedo-guy-diver-lawsuit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Slate<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson told the court that the case would hinge on whether a reasonable person would read Musk\u2019s tweets as accusing Unsworth of pedophilia. Alex Spiro, Musk\u2019s lawyer, asserted in his opening statement that the term \u201cpedo guy\u201d is in fact a nebulous insult that was popular during Musk\u2019s youth in South Africa and does not literally refer to pedophilia. During his own testimony on Tuesday, Musk said, \u201c \u2018Pedo guy\u2019 is used in other countries also. It\u2019s quite common in the English-speaking world. I\u2019m quite confident if you do a search, it will just say \u2018creepy old dude.\u2019<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Musk apologized a couple of days after sending the \u201cpedo guy\u201d tweet:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader.

Its users have shown an increasing distrust in it, and a new survey suggests they aren\u2019t the only ones.<\/p>\n<p>The survey was run by TeamBlind, the company behind the Blind anonymous social networking app. The app\u2019s designed to allow professionals from major companies to connect with each other, and TeamBlind runs several surveys like this. It published the results for this one earlier in the week.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>The survey centered around two questions: \u201cDo you trust traditional banks or big tech companies more with your financial data?\u201d and \u201cWhich tech giant would you\u00a0be most willing to share your financial data with?\u201d The tech giants in this case are Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Uber.<\/p>\n<p>The first question, which was put to\u00a0<span>5,138 Blind users, found that most prefer traditional banks, with 62 percent trusting them more.\u00a0<\/span>Further, 57 percent of tech employees felt the same way. By itself, this might not be the biggest deal \u2014 opinions change gradually, and most of us have been with big banks so long we\u2019re scared of changing, even if we work for the industry to which we\u2019d be changing. It was the response to the second question that was most telling.<\/p>\n<p>There were two results for this question. First, a general response to which company was most trusted, and then the percentage of employees from those specific companies who would trust their bosses with their financial details.<\/p>\n<p>The Facebook results are nothing short of hilarious. Only 22 percent of Facebook employees surveyed said they\u2019d trust their own company to handle their financial information. What\u2019s more, in the general poll, just over 2 percent of all of the respondents said they\u2019d be willing to share their financial data with Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>This tallies closely with other polls that suggest civilian users distrust Facebook in equal numbers. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/meet-the-press\/poll-americans-give-social-media-clear-thumbs-down-n991086?curator=TechREDEF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">An NBC\/Wall Street Journal poll<\/a> earlier this year found that 60 percent of American respondents don\u2019t trust the site to protect their personal info. Further, 74 percent said that allowing companies to harvest their data isn\u2019t a fair tradeoff for their services remaining free.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook didn\u2019t exactly fair the worst in the Blind survey. Only 17 percent of Uber employees surveyed said they\u2019d trust their company, and exactly 2 percent of respondents generally said they\u2019d trust it. So Uber\u2019s technically the least trusted, but Uber\u2019s not currently pushing\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/hardfork\/2019\/10\/21\/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-gets-desperate-as-it-considers-stablecoins\/\">its own cryptocurrency<\/a> (that we know of) or a <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/facebook\/2019\/11\/13\/facebook-pay-will-let-you-make-payments-through-messenger-whatsapp-and-instagram\/\">pay system in its messaging app<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In case you\u2019re interested, the company with the highest degree of trust among its employees was Apple, with 91 percent of employees who responded expressing their trust.

Over the past couple of days, leaks have all but confirmed Samsung is working on an S10 Lite (A91) \u2013 not to be confused with the S10e \u2013 and Note 10 Lite (A81).<\/p>\n<p>Though we first heard about the Galaxy S10 Lite\/A91 over the summer, yesterday reliable leaker @OnLeaks published a set of renders of the phone in partnership with 91mobiles. The S10 Lite had previously been confirmed by an <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.fcc.gov\/oetcf\/eas\/reports\/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=KYZ1q5d2DWpt6Iy1NEt2Mw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=A3LSMG770F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">FCC filing<\/a>.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"97Rh6ARO\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DWQwK-GLbYQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The phone looks largely similar to the upcoming <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/11\/23\/these-renders-show-what-samsungs-galaxy-s11-might-look-like\/\">Galaxy S11<\/a>, notable for its large rectangular camera bump on the rear with three or four camera (the leaker isn\u2019t sure). This bump also includes a rectangular cutout that likely suggests a periscope-type lens for extra-far optical zoom. On the front, there\u2019s a single central camera cutout for your selfies.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, it looks like a pretty normal glass sandwich phone. And in case you\u2019re wondering, no, it does not have a headphone jack.<\/p>\n<p>We do already know some of the device\u2019s specs,\u00a0with rumors pointing to a 6.7-inch FHD display, a Snapdragon 855, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,500 mAh battery, and the phone is expected to come in a 5G variant. Other than the display, those specs are surprisingly flagship-y. Perhaps Samsung is feeling the <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/09\/26\/hands-on-the-oneplus-7t-first-impressions-camera-screen\/\">pressure from OnePlus<\/a>\u00a0and wants to deliver high-end specs at a lower price.<\/p>\n<p>The Note 10 Lite, also shared by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.91mobiles.com\/hub\/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-note-10-lite-renders-design-s-pen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">@OnLeaks and 91Mobiles<\/a>, features a similar design and near-identical camera setup, except it comes with an S-Pen. Curiously, the Note 10 Lite is currently expected to come with weaker specs, including last year\u2019s Exynos 9810 and 6GB of internal RAM.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260012 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1068\" height=\"601\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1068px) 100vw, 1068px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/GALAXY_A81_NOTE10_LITE_2-1-1068x601.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/GALAXY_A81_NOTE10_LITE_2-1-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/GALAXY_A81_NOTE10_LITE_2-1-1068x601-280x158.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/GALAXY_A81_NOTE10_LITE_2-1-1068x601-480x270.jpg 480w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/GALAXY_A81_NOTE10_LITE_2-1-1068x601-240x135.jpg 240w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/GALAXY_A81_NOTE10_LITE_2-1-1068x601-796x448.jpg 796w\"><figcaption>Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.91mobiles.com\/hub\/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-note-10-lite-renders-design-s-pen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">91Mobiles\/OnLeaks<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>On the plus side, this phone\u00a0<em>does<\/em> come with a headphone jack.

Well, at least on paper anyway.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>This story is both exciting \u2013 Alphabet is probably the most important company in the world \u2013 and boring. Did anyone not see this coming?<\/p>\n<p>As the Verge\u2019s Dieter Bohn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/12\/4\/20994896\/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-era-culture-antitrust-regulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">put it<\/a> today:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a strictly technical, definitional sense, this is an \u201cera-changing\u201d moment because there\u2019s a new CEO for Alphabet. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of the company, are stepping back from running things and any time the founders change jobs, it means something. Arriving randomly on a Tuesday afternoon, it felt surprising and big.<\/p>\n<p>But it also felt a little like a non-event, just a formalization of how things have been working anyway.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The consensus among technology journalists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/12\/04\/opinion\/google-larry-page-sergey-brin.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">appears to be<\/a> that Sundar Pichai is the sober, corporate-friendly leader that\u2019ll keep the <a href=\"https:\/\/abc.xyz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Alphabet umbrella<\/a> competitive in a market that cares more about your next product than your last one.<\/p>\n<p>Bohn says Pichai\u2018s job was \u201cto take Google\u2019s products out of permanent beta. At the same time, he\u2019s had to ensure future technologies \u2014 especially those based on AI \u2014 turned into real products. From a purely product perspective, which of course includes the lucrative ad products that make the whole thing go, Pichai has been very successful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to argue against Pichai\u2018s success. Few companies have the commercial power that Google does. But, what does commercial power have to do with Google? Was I really that naive when I bought everything Brin and Page were selling in the beginning?<\/p>\n<p>After 9\/11 I needed to believe that the future would be better than the present. What Page and Brin did during the subsequent decade made us all believe that technology had advanced to the point where the smartest people in the room can snap their fingers and change the world <em>for the better<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, the company\u2019s actions over the <em>next<\/em> decade showed us that our <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_relationship_energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">new relationship energy<\/a> had blinded us to the truth about Google: it\u2019s a magic trick, an illusion. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Google saves lives and is responsible for more technological innovation than most of its peers.<\/p>\n<p>However it is a mathematical certainty that someone who randomly throws a trillion darts at a dart board will score more bullseyes than someone who takes a few well-aimed shots.\u00a0Google can afford a lot of darts so it\u2019s never had to worry much about aim.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t seem like Brin and Page ever focused on what could go wrong. Changing the world is much easier when you put all of your energy into wondering what could go right. Unfortunately, things haven\u2019t always gone to plan:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/tech\/2019\/12\/04\/fired-google-employees-will-charge-the-company-with-unfair-labor-practices\/\">Fired Google employees will charge the company with \u2018unfair labor practices\u2019<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/google\/2018\/07\/18\/google-eu-antitrust-android-fine-5billion-europe\/\">Google fined a record $5B for breaking EU antitrust laws<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/insider\/2018\/11\/01\/thousands-of-google-employees-walk-out-to-protest-harassment-inequality\/\">Thousands of Google employees walk out to protest harassment, inequality<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/google\/2018\/10\/16\/amazon-gets-patriotic-while-google-embraces-censorship\/\">Amazon gets patriotic while Google embraces censorship<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/syndication\/2018\/08\/06\/chinas-censored-google-is-an-ethical-catastrophe\/\">China\u2019s censored Google is an ethical catastrophe<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2018\/05\/15\/google-employees-quit-over-the-companys-military-ai-project\/\">Google employees quit over the company\u2019s military AI project<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/google\/2018\/10\/11\/congress-is-fed-up-with-google-after-it-hid-major-data-breach-for-months\/\">Congress is fed up with Google after it hid major bug for months<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/insider\/2019\/04\/23\/google-walkout-organizers-publicly-accuse-google-of-punishing-them\/\">Google Walkout organizers publicly accuse Google of punishing them<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/tech\/2019\/11\/22\/google-employees-protest-suspension-of-two-activist-colleagues\/\">Google employees protest suspension of two activist colleagues<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2018\/09\/13\/google-clouds-new-ai-head-comes-with-his-own-ties-to-the-pentagons-project-maven\/\">Google Cloud\u2019s new AI head comes with his own ties to the Pentagon\u2019s Project Maven<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/google\/2018\/09\/07\/german-protesters-clash-with-police-over-proposed-google-campus\/\">German protesters clash with police over proposed Google campus<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/tech\/2019\/11\/07\/alphabet-is-investigating-googles-handling-of-recent-sexual-harassment-claims\/\">Alphabet is investigating Google\u2019s handling of recent sexual harassment claims<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2019\/10\/08\/google-exploited-homeless-black-people-to-develop-the-pixel-4s-facial-recognition-ai\/\">Google exploited homeless black people to develop the Pixel 4\u2019s facial recognition AI<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And this is just a smattering of the recent stuff under Pichai\u2018s leadership. This isn\u2019t meant to point out that Pichai is the wrong person for the job. He\u2019s perfect for Brin and Page. Pichai\u2019s the person who massages their reality.<\/p>\n<p>When the media lashes out we\u2019re blaming Pichai, not them. And even then our outrage only lasts until the next technology conference. For years this paradigm has worked very well for Alphabet and Google.<\/p>\n<p>But after decades of turning a deaf ear and a blind eye to the potentially catastrophic ramifications of paradigm-shifting technologies, it seems like the company\u2019s\u00a0leadership can no longer feasibly feign ignorance. The world watched last year as it <a href=\"https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">changed its motto from<\/a> \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d to \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d The former statement, it feels, applies to the humanity of the company\u2019s\u00a0employees. But \u201cdo the right thing\u201d seems like something you tell someone before adding \u201cfor the company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s changed. It\u2019s just as idealistic as ever, but as Dr. Fei-Fei Li <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/artificial-intelligence\/2018\/09\/10\/ai-guru-fei-fei-li-set-to-leave-google-this-year\/\">found out<\/a>, it\u2019s an incubator for ideas that places infinitely more value on the ideas themselves than the ramifications of those ideas. It\u2019s a company that\u2019s always stuck on the first draft of a product because it never takes the time to fully develop anything to truly serve humanity first. Sundar Pichai and the Googlers who work for him aren\u2019t beholden to the greater good or their customers, despite what they may actually believe. Google isn\u2019t beholden to money either, it has plenty; it merely <em>wants<\/em>\u00a0more.<\/p>\n<p>No, they\u2019re perpetually fixated on a broken ideal. Under Pichai, Googlers are members of the cult of personality that centers around Brin and Page\u2018s dogmatic view that technology for technology\u2019s sake \u2013 moving fast and breaking things \u2013 is the key to innovation.<\/p>\n<p>As long as Google steams forward with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/06\/17\/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-youtube-is-too-big-to-fix.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">no regard for what happens in its wake<\/a>, the allure of the church of Brin and Page remains stronger than any researcher\u2019s objections or politician\u2019s call for regulation. Google makes progress look easy by avoiding some hard truths. But even geniuses like Brin and Page can\u2019t always stride gallantly forth into the future when pesky experts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-04-01\/google-s-brand-new-ai-ethics-council-is-already-falling-apart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">keep pointing out<\/a> that Google\u2018s trailblazing a dangerous path.<\/p>\n<p>In this respect, Sundar Pichai is the antidote to Google\u2019s\u00a0founders\u2019 lingering consciences. His cool, measured presence reinvigorates that initial spirit of optimistic capitalism that makes it easy to dismiss questions like \u201cwhat negative effects could gendering virtual assistants or releasing inherently-biased AI products to the public have on our society?\u201d as \u201csmall picture\u201d problems. He inspires those around him to live by platitudes instead \u2013 Google\u2018s making the world a better place, look at all the good it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n<p>Pichai is the leader that can tell you with a straight face that his dirty hands are clean and believe it. While Brin seemingly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2010\/mar\/24\/google-china-sergey-brin-censorship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">gets wishy-washy<\/a> over tough topics like censorship the moment someone makes a suggestion that <a href=\"https:\/\/notes.rjgallagher.co.uk\/2018\/08\/google-china-dragonfly-sergey-brin-yacht.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">eases his worldview<\/a> into a more company-friendly slot, Pichai can quietly and calmly embrace and defend such repugnant concepts as though <em>we\u2019re<\/em> the unethical ones for not understanding his big picture. That\u2019s quite a talent \u2014 one he shares with <a href=\"https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2019\/05\/14\/google-search-china-eric-schmidt-comments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">his predecessor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And when it comes to Page, who always seems to have the answers, he can no longer lead Alphabet and Google from his lofty vantage point as the smartest daydreamer in the room without also facing the company\u2019s perceived descent into the same sludge that DuPont, Exxon, Facebook, and Uber occupy. He could grow up and pivot as Bill Gates seemingly did, but he won\u2019t. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/larry-page-says-googles-china-plans-are-no-longer-his-decision-2015-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">He\u2019s got Sundar Pichai to protect him from that<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Brin and Page are moving out of Pichai\u2018s way so that he can do what he does best: whatever the hell they tell him to.<\/p>\n<p>The startup that made us all believe in innovation again just became a conservative enterprise. Let\u2019s check back in a decade to see how that works out.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>We know, with a reasonable degree of certainty now, that Sony is out of the handheld console game is over. No follow-ups to the Vita or the PSP are forthcoming. So now that it\u2019s over, what can Sony learn about mobile gaming going forward?<\/p>\n<p>The news comes, ironically, during Sony\u2019s celebration of the PlayStation brand\u2019s 25th birthday. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) CEO Jim Ryan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/feature\/2019\/12\/03\/the-first-25-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">told\u00a0<em>GameInformer<\/em> during its retrospective<\/a> that the Vita was \u201c<span>brilliant in many ways, and the actual gaming experience was great, but clearly it\u2019s a business that we\u2019re no longer in\u00a0now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Yeah, we all knew, especially after the Vita was cancelled, that the possibility of another was not likely. Even I, a diehard Vita fan, was not holding my breath. But its nice to hear that Sony execs themselves recognize that the Vita, while not a product of its time, was brilliant in its own way. I concur, for what it\u2019s worth, and not just because I\u2019m one of the roughly baker\u2019s dozen who still owns my Vita.<\/p>\n<p>The Vita was indeed, a decent handheld that played with some new ideas of what a handheld could do: for example, it was the one of the first to link to its larger counterpart and allow you to play your AAA games on mobile. It just plain didn\u2019t sell. The PSP didn\u2019t actually do too badly, as handheld sales go \u2014 the numbers might even be called \u201cgood\u201d were it not for the fact that Nintendo had the handheld console market under lock and key by the time it came out.<\/p>\n<p>Still, while this means we most likely won\u2019t see any more Sony gaming handhelds, I wonder if the company could invest in mobile gaming in the vein of the Nintendo Switch \u2014 meaning, as a compliment to a TV-bound, terrestrial console. The Switch accomplished this by building the handheld inside the TV-bound console. Sony, on the other hand, is offering players the chance to link their games to their phones via the PS4 Remote Play app, which is not nothing (and actually works fairly well, all things considered).<\/p>\n<p>I think the biggest takeaway from this should be, \u201cDon\u2019t try to beat Nintendo at the game it perfected.\u201d In other words, the next generation of Sony gaming will need a new trick if Sony really wants to try and capture a mobile market. And it might still want to do that. John Kodera, now-deputy president of SIE, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-05-23\/sony-s-new-playstation-chief-hints-at-portable-gaming-revival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">told Bloomberg in 2018<\/a> that the company was still interested in mobile: \u201c<span>In my opinion, rather than separating portable gaming from consoles, it\u2019s necessary to continue thinking of it as one method to deliver more gaming experiences and exploring what our customers want from portable.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The best path forward \u2014 and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, given my many issues with Google Stadia \u2014 might be cloud gaming. Emulating Nintendo isn\u2019t going to work this time, though I\u2019m sure the thought crossed Sony\u2019s collective mind (a patent for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ign.com\/articles\/2017\/02\/17\/sony-files-patent-for-what-looks-like-a-switch-esque-handheld\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a suspiciously Switch-like device<\/a> filed by Sony surfaced in 2017). But, just as before, Sony has that particular market in its pocket. So the best option for mobile might be getting the games onto the devices we already have, such as our phones and tablets.<\/p>\n<p><em>via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/sony-hints-that-its-done-with-handheld-consoles-ruling-out-a-ps-vita-or-psp-return\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Techradar<\/a><\/em><\/p>",

In California, Uber now lets you set a driver as a \u2018favorite\u2019 in its app after you\u2019ve rated them five stars. This feature was first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/tech\/uber-launches-favourite-driver-feature-16536124\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">tested in the UK<\/a> earlier this year, but now appears to be expanding to other regions.<\/p>\n<p>The feature doesn\u2019t seem to do much for now other than serve as a sort of bookmark. But Uber says \u201cin early 2020, riders will be able to request their favorite drivers when scheduling a trip in advance.\u201d Favorite drivers will get first dibs on scheduled rides, potentially giving them a frequent customer. But drivers needn\u2019t worry about getting stuck with an awful rider; if you give them a 1-star rating, Uber won\u2019t match you with them again.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>For riders, being able to favorite drivers allows you to ride with someone you already know and trust, potentially adding a little peace of mind if you\u2019re scheduling an important trip.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe you\u2019ve had fun conversations, maybe you like that the driver\u00a0<em>doesn\u2019t<\/em> talk, or maybe you just like the driver\u2019s car. Either way, it\u2019s a welcome feature that gives both riders and drivers a little more flexibility and helps make Uber more personal.<\/p>\n<p>Uber is making a couple of other changes to help drivers too. For one, drivers will finally be able to see where their passengers are going, how long the trip will take, and how much they can expect to earn from it. It\u2019s remarkable such information has taken so long.<\/p>\n<p>No word on if or when you\u2019ll be able to favorite drivers in other regions, but we\u2019ve reached out to Uber and will update this post if we hear back.<\/p>\n<p>Via <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2019\/12\/04\/uber-passengers-in-california-can-favorite-drivers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Engadget<\/a><\/em>, <em><a href=\"https:\/\/therideshareguy.com\/uber-rolling-out-new-driver-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Ride Share Guy<\/a><\/em><\/p>",

Welcome to part two, where we\u2019ll combine Robinhood\u2019s data with other public sources to quantify the level of risk Robinhood users are taking, specifically in relation to how well (or poorly) diversified their portfolios seem to be.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>At the start of November, we downloaded the full <a href=\"https:\/\/robintrack.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Robintrack<\/a> database, which records how many Robinhood users hold a particular stock over time. While the public data doesn\u2019t contain total share-buying volumes, it still provides us with a wealth of information \u2014 even more so when combined with other readily available data about these publicly listed companies.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>To assess the amount of risk undertaken on Robinhood\u2019s platform as a whole, we have to look at how well diversified the holdings are. Now, diversification comes in many forms, so we\u2019re going to look at several of them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diversification across multiple stocks\/ETFs<\/li>\n<li>Diversification across sectors<\/li>\n<li>Diversification across industries<\/li>\n<li>Diversification across stocks vs ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds, basically baskets of a wide range of stocks)<\/li>\n<li>Diversification across company sizes<\/li>\n<li>Diversification across countries\/regions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As Robintrack\u2019s data doesn\u2019t contain all of this additional information, we\u2019ve combined it with Yahoo Finance\u2019s publicly available data.<\/p>\n<h2>Diversification across multiple stocks\/ETFs<\/h2>\n<p>Robinhood currently has approximately 6 million users. According to Robintrack\u2019s data, there exist just over 12 million unique holdings, meaning that the average Robinhood user owns stocks in two different publicly listed companies or ETFs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Just looking at the average amount of unique ownerships per user, the standard Robinhood user doesn\u2019t look very diversified.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Diversification across sectors<\/h2>\n<p>If we focus on specific stock holdings, not including ETFs, the distribution of stock holdings by sector among Robinhood users looks as follows. For comparison, we added a column for the market cap of each sector as a percentage of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s total market cap.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1259948 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"1066\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/sector.png\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/sector.png 1176w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/sector-232x210.png 232w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/sector-298x270.png 298w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/sector-149x135.png 149w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/sector-796x722.png 796w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>If we look at the market cap of each sector as a percentage of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s total market cap, the information technology sector actually is the largest, but not nearly as large as the percentage of unique holdings among Robinhood users.<\/p>\n<p>To be fair, this disparity might be amplified by the fact that the free shares given to new customers (and existing ones referring new customers) often concerns that of a technology company like Fitbit or GoPro, with a stock price of less than $10.<\/p>\n<p>Other big disparities exist for the Consumer Cyclical (much more popular on Robinhood), Financial Services, Consumer Defensive, Communication Services, and Utilities (a lot less popular on Robinhood) sectors.<\/p>\n<p>The top three sectors among Robinhood users comprise 67% of all stock holdings, while the top three sectors by market cap only account for 41%.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This means that sector-wise, Robinhood seems much less diversified than the market in general. Overexposure in one particular sector, in this case tech, obviously poses risks.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Diversification across industries<\/h2>\n<p>Now, if we look at industries, which are even more specific than sectors, we see the following are the most popular among Robinhood users. Again, we added a column for the market cap of each industry as a percentage of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s total market cap, as a comparison.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1259946 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1180\" height=\"1012\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/industry.png\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/industry.png 1180w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/industry-245x210.png 245w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/industry-315x270.png 315w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/industry-157x135.png 157w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/industry-796x683.png 796w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, Robinhood users are betting relatively big on Biotechnology and Auto Manufacturers, and relatively small on Oil and Gas. With a price of around $9, Ford stocks might be skewing these results as they\u2019re commonly given away to new and referring users.<\/p>\n<p>The top ten industries among Robinhood users comprise 49% of all stock holdings, while the top ten industries by market cap account for 45%. Popular industries which, in general, can\u2019t be found among Robinhood users\u2019 most popular stocks concern Banks (1), and Insurance (9). Facing trust (financial crisis) and environmental (climate change) issues, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that these industries are less popular among Robinhood\u2019s predominantly millennial target audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Industry-wise Robinhood\u2019s total unique stock portfolio selection seems a bit less diversified, one can also view its users\u2019 choices as simply different from the general public \u2014 more mindful of the environment, and more future-focused.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><b>Stock pickings vs ETFs<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Just 5% of all unique Robinhood holdings concern ETFs, which accounts for 640,000 out of the 12 million total. An estimated 8.5% (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/blog\/2019\/08\/01\/etf-market-share.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">4 trillion<\/a>) of the total investments made on the US stock market concern ETF investments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This means Robinhood users are underinvested in ETFs \u2014 which are generally considered less risky \u2014 instead of specific stock picks, and thus seem less diversified on this front as well.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Diversification across company sizes<\/h2>\n<p>If we look at the sizes of companies that Robinhood users invest in, we see the following distribution.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1259947 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1166\" height=\"792\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1166px) 100vw, 1166px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/cap.png\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/cap.png 1166w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/cap-280x190.png 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/cap-398x270.png 398w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/cap-199x135.png 199w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/12\/cap-796x541.png 796w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><strong>Robinhood users are relatively highly invested (again, in terms of unique holdings) into specific smaller cap companies, which are generally considered more volatile and risky to invest in. Smaller caps usually have lower stock prices as well, so they might be picked more often as a free stock for new and referring users.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Diversification across countries\/continents<\/h2>\n<p>Since Robinhood users cannot directly trade on foreign exchanges, but only invest in a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.robinhood.com\/news\/2018\/8\/27\/introducing-global-stocks-on-robinhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">limited amount of ADRs<\/a> (American depositary receipts, read about the difference between \u2018foreign ordinaries\u2019 and ADRs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/story\/1333254\/1\/what-works-getting-started-at-trading-foreign-stocks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>), diversification by country or region is automatically also limited. Diving into the data for this particular form of diversification therefore doesn\u2019t make sense, as any insight gathered isn\u2019t robust enough to draw any conclusions.<\/p>\n<h2>Ending remarks<\/h2>\n<p>First of all, it\u2019s important to reiterate that the free stocks given away can skew the data so much that we can\u2019t be conclusive about the level of diversification by sector, industry, or company size, even though that data doesn\u2019t look reassuring at first glance.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, one can argue that Robinhood pushes its users in the wrong direction (in terms of relatively safe investing) by giving away stocks of often smaller cap companies. Larger cap stocks (of well-established companies expected to continue as profitable businesses) and ETFs are generally considered safer investments.<\/p>\n<p>Also, a large part of the users seem to stick with the free stock, as the average unique holdings per user accounts for just two. So the majority of its users aren\u2019t well-diversified when taking the breadth of their Robinhood portfolio into consideration.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s safe to say that by looking solely at Robinhood\u2019s total investment portfolio, its (potential) users would definitely benefit from increased education on the risks of investing, and the strategies to decrease these risks so they\u2019re less likely to treat the stock market as a casino.<\/p>\n<p><em>We reached out to Robinhood for comment, and received the following reaction:<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While we\u2019re a self-directed brokerage and don\u2019t offer investment advice, we do offer a variety of informational resources for people: Robinhood Snacks (newsletter and podcast), online articles (basic information on investing), and in-app newsfeed (market news from outlets such as WSJ, CNN, Reuters, and Cheddar).<\/p><\/blockquote><\/p>",

But as one of the most exciting new fields of emerging technology, there\u2019s an incredibly wide array of use cases for blockchain \u2014 as well as many empty promises and scams. When it comes to combating the age old problem of how to prevent sexual assault, it\u2019s clear we need to look for new ways to do so. Blockchain\u2019s ability to store and record information and anonymize records holds promising potential to help survivors of sexual crime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introducing the new app, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/smashboard.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smashboard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an India-based alternative social media network with specific features to challenge rape culture and create an all-inclusive, feminist online community for survivors of sexual assault and allies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app, which is available to download in India on both Android and iOS devices, harnesses the Ethereum blockchain to privatize and encrypt users\u2019 messaging to create a safer online space through complete pseudo-anonymization. The app\u2019s features include an indelible time-stamped journal for survivors to record events of their sexual assault, which can, they say, eventually be used as evidence in court proceedings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding to this, the non-profit app offers an extensive list of mental health and legal practitioners resources, a forum for users to seek and offer help within the community, and a newsfeed showing articles from feminist publications with an option to leave anonymous tips for journalists if they wish to share their story of sexual assault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All users can remain anonymous when using the app, which allegedly doesn\u2019t harvest data or use location-tracking software.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><script src='\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/players\/qvldsYRZ-8HjO2koJ.js'> <\/script><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Smashboard uses blockchain to protect the identity of its users, it has plans to launch its own coin. However, the use of cryptocurrency is currently banned in India. Speaking to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/india\/1758197\/after-metoo-an-app-now-uses-blockchain-against-sexual-abuse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quartz<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Noopur Tiwari, the founder of the app, said she believes that if crypto was legalized and properly regulated, Smashboard could launch a coin called \u201cSMASH\u201d to fund feminist campaigns, digital tools, and grassroots initiatives from investors who are ideologically aligned with the cause.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This app connects survivors and allies alike through its app, however right now it\u2019s only available in English, Spanish, and French but has plans to expand its language options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSMASH coin will run on Ethereum as well. Blockchain is hailed as the technology that will, in the near future, radically transform the way things are done online. It is indeed potentially disruptive because it is essentially a medium for decentralization,\u201d Tiwari told TNW. \u201cThe breakdown of patriarchal institutions and structures as envisioned by feminists is also disruptive. Hence, blockchain appeals to feminism \u2014especially when the technology is extended to socio political-arenas. By being amongst the early majority (since blockchain is no longer \u201cnew\u201d), women can mould and use the technology for their common purpose of dismantling patriarchy.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology is black and white, but the world of humans is not. We can never solely rely on technology to protect us, because technology can never be a replacement for a healthy sexual culture, where consent is respected and discussed openly. However, Smashboard offers hope in creating a safe online space for survivors at a time when the #MeToo movement in India is causing waves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>",

Young Asians have an optimistic view of AI as a whole. A Microsoft\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/apac\/2017\/02\/22\/asia-pacific-youth-expect-artificial-intelligence-to-have-biggest-impact-on-their-future-microsoft-survey\/#sm.0007383o916ttfdiu0y2fsm10uuf5%3E%3Cspan%20style=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">survey<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>found that 39 percent of young Asians foresee a future with connected or driverless cars, 36 percent fathom a world where there will be software robots that improve productivity and 19 percent imagine robots as social companions.<\/p>\n<p>The youth in the continent are looking forward to AI increasing their productivity, facilitating the way they connect with others and improving their physical and mental health. Job loss due to automation, which is a paramount concern in many parts of the world, seems to have taken a back seat in Asia, with only 26 percent worried about losing their jobs to technology.<\/p>\n<p>Each of the countries in Asia is at a different level of technological development. The progress of AI also naturally differs by country and region. McKinsey states that, while the United States is considered to be the leader in the global AI sphere, China is the runner up. This can be reinforced by looking at how many people are employed in the AI field worldwide. According to the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Business\/Technology\/Asia-s-AI-talent-pool-broadens-except-in-Japan%3Cspan%20style=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Nikkei Asian Review<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>, the Canadian AI startup Element estimates that there are 22,400 top talents in AI worldwide \u2013 10,295 of them are in the United States while 2,525 are in China.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span>\u201cThere are 22,400 top talents in AI worldwide \u2013 10,295 of them are in the United States while 2,525 are in China\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Element also found that Japan was an outlier to the AI talent scene with only 805 top talents working in the country, which is the world\u2019s third-largest economy. Japan will have a huge deficit of AI talent in the future if it doesn\u2019t fill the void quickly enough. On the other hand, Singapore is relatively stocked with AI talent, with 40 percent returning to the country after obtaining the requisite skills abroad. Chinese, South Korean and Indian talents are also heading back to their countries of origin after studying in other countries.<\/p>\n<p><span>What is Shaping AI in Asia?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In order to understand how AI is taking shape in Asia, particularly Southeast Asia and East Asia, Binary District spoke with IBM Japan and<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/muthukumarc87\/%3Cspan%20style=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Muthu Kumar Chandrasekaran<\/a>, an AI expert specializing in machine learning and natural language processing.<\/p>\n<p>We began by asking each about the challenges and opportunities that exist in the AI field in Japan and Singapore respectively. The IBM spokesperson expressed concern around labor shortages and low labor productivity in the country, as well as Japan\u2019s declining population.<\/p>\n<p>According to IBM, this represents a big challenge for the AI sector, as \u201cmany enterprises cannot start using AI due to lack of strategies and leaders, lack of skills and human resources, and many enterprises do not proceed to actual operation because PoC does not produce the expected results. There are many companies that have been put into operation but are not using small-scale and narrow areas, and have not advanced their digital transformation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chandrasekaran, on the other hand, is optimistic about the Far East as it has always been a \u2018great playground for applications when new technologies hit the market.\u201d \u201cUnlike in the West,\u201d he says, \u201cthe Far East does not have anti-trust tendencies towards technology companies using user data for machine learning. This has resulted in the Far East becoming the first to get technologies such as facial recognition in the real world and fully realizing the power of online social networks for recommendation systems.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Far East has a larger local technical labor force than in the West. This is driving western companies to open their largest development centers there. This indicates the potential for innovation that still remains untapped.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span>\u201cUnlike in the West, the Far East does not have anti-trust tendencies towards technology companies using user data for machine learning\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWhile Singapore has created a great start-up ecosystem in the last few years, other larger Far Eastern economies are yet to fully commit to such an initiative. Chinese companies are still focused on the local markets and haven\u2019t adapted their brands to compete with western companies globally. The governments in India and Japan can do more in terms of policies and investment to encourage <span style=\"background-color: rgba(46, 146, 255, 0.2);\">AI-based<\/span>\u00a0start-ups.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like other emerging technologies, AI has been in danger of getting swallowed up in its own hype. It is possible, though, to gauge the state of emerging technology by looking closely at various new developments associated with it.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to Japan, for example, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is gaining momentum. IBM states that instead of developing an AI model from scratch, it is necessary to use learned AI such as NLP and Image Recognition provided by a vendor that can fit the enterprise\u2019s business needs.<\/p>\n<p>IBM Japan, for example, launched Watson, which supports the Japanese language in 2016. \u201cIn the case of IBM Watson, many APIs can be customized by learning enterprise-specific data, and these can be combined to develop AI applications that meet your needs,\u201d the company tells us.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAI applications are already being developed and used in various industries and operations. For example, AI applications for customer services that respond to proposals for appropriate products and confirmation and change of order information, and AI applications that support professionals such as operators and engineers are being developed and put into production, and are used to cover the labor shortage and to provide higher service quality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are exciting developments happening elsewhere in Asia as well. Chandrasekaran points to the use of facial recognition technology in real-world applications in China as well as the rise of self-driving car companies in both China and Singapore. He also notes the large volume of accepted papers from the Far East in top academic AI conferences as an indicator of an AI boom in the region.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cData-driven social networking companies that have changed the shopping and payment industry for the better in China are a great example of where the Far East is ahead of the West,\u201d Chandrasekaran says. \u201cStrong will from governments in the region to invest in large nationwide AI programs (e.g. AI Singapore) with civilian participation is very different from western government funding programs through their defense research arms. Civilian participation and enthusiasm are necessary for the adaptation of AI in people\u2019s daily lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course, every part of Asia has its own unique culture, which does have an effect on how technology progresses in individual nations. Japan has always been one of the world\u2019s premier manufacturing hubs.

It doesn\u2019t do a huge amount more than the Xs. But what it does do is everything. Better.<\/p>\n<p>With the iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple has made an incredibly polished and powerful phone that\u2019s a downright joy to use \u2014 which is why it is, in my opinion, the best phone of 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has directly addressed some of the concerns people had with its previous phones. After the introduction of an extra lens and some beefed-up image-processing, the iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2018s camera set-up is now the equal of anything on the market. The battery life is also breathtaking, with the phone regularly lasting me two working days.<\/p>\n<p>The best way I can describe the iPhone 11 Pro Max is no matter which phone I\u2019m currently testing and trialing, I\u2019m always excited to get back to Apple\u2018s handset.

For that, the phone\u2018s arsenal of 40-megapixel main camera, a wide-angle camera, a telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, and time-of-flight sensor was more than sufficient.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, the phone has one of the cleanest and most non-intrusive software set-ups I\u2019ve ever seen on a Huawei device.

Unlike other folding phones that try to give you an even bigger screen to do more on, Motorola is giving you a big screen in a compact frame. It\u2019s clamshell design means it\u2019s a phone that, in a way, encourages you to use your phone less. In the this age of information saturation, that\u2019s something most of us can use.<\/p>\n<p>It might not even be out yet, but the Motorola Razr might just be the best phone of 2019.

A huge number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nobelprize.org\/prizes\/themes\/the-nobel-prize-in-physics-1901-2000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">theoretical and experimental discoveries<\/a> have transformed our understanding of the universe, and our place within it.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script>\n            <script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script>\n        \n<p>Don\u2019t expect the next century to be any different. The universe has many mysteries that still remain to be uncovered \u2013 and new technologies will help us to solve them over the next 50 years.<\/p>\n<p>The first concerns the fundamentals of our existence. Physics predicts that the Big Bang produced equal amounts of the matter you are made of and something called <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/explainer-what-is-antimatter-53414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">antimatter<\/a>. Most particles of matter have an antimatter twin, identical but with the opposite electric charge. When the two meet, they annihilate each other, with all their energy converted into light.<\/p>\n<p>But the universe today is made almost entirely out of matter. So <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/explainer-what-is-antimatter-53414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">where has all the antimatter gone<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has offered some insight into this question. It collides protons at unimaginable speeds, creating heavy particles of matter and antimatter that decay into lighter particles, several of which had never been seen before.<\/p>\n<p>The LHC has shown that matter and antimatter decay at slightly different rates. This goes part \u2013 but nowhere near all \u2013 of the way to explaining why we see an asymmetry in nature.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that compared to the precision physicists are used to, the LHC is like playing table tennis with a tennis racquet. As protons are made up of smaller particles, when they collide their innards get sprayed all over the place, making it much harder to spot new particles among the debris. This makes it difficult to accurately measure their properties for further clues to why so much antimatter has disappeared.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linearcollider.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Three new colliders<\/a> will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linearcollider.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">change the game<\/a> in the coming decades. Chief among them is the <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/cern-large-hadron-collider-replacement-plans-unveiled-heres-what-it-could-discover-109983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Future Circular Collider (FCC)<\/a> \u2013 a 100km tunnel encircling Geneva, which will use the 27km LHC as a slipway. Instead of protons, the colliders will smash together electrons and their antiparticles, positrons, at much higher speeds than the LHC could achieve.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304073\/original\/file-20191127-112526-sjtqy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304073\/original\/file-20191127-112526-sjtqy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304073\/original\/file-20191127-112526-sjtqy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304073\/original\/file-20191127-112526-sjtqy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304073\/original\/file-20191127-112526-sjtqy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304073\/original\/file-20191127-112526-sjtqy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304073\/original\/file-20191127-112526-sjtqy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F04%2Fthese-new-technologies-will-soon-answer-our-biggest-questions-about-the-universe%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: The LHC\u2019s 27km collider is nothing compared to what\u2019s coming.

One possibility is that the disappearance of antimatter could be related to the existence of dark matter \u2013 the thus far undetectable particles that make up a whopping 85 percent of mass in the universe. The absence of antimatter and prevalence of dark matter probably owe themselves to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/higgs-boson-could-explain-antimatter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">conditions present during the Big Bang<\/a>, so these experiments probe right into the origins of our existence.<\/p>\n<p>It is impossible to predict how as-yet hidden discoveries from collider experiments will change our lives.

But the upcoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jwst.nasa.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">James Webb Space Telescope<\/a>, launching in 2021, will revolutionize the way that we detect habitable exoplanets.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike previous telescopes, which measure the dip in a star\u2019s light as an orbiting planet passes in front of it, James Webb will use an instrument called a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.space.com\/what-is-a-coronagraph.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">coronagraph<\/a> to block the light from a star entering the telescope. This works in much the same way as using your hand to block sunlight from entering your eyes. The technique will allow the telescope to directly observe small planets that would ordinarily be overwhelmed by the bright glare of the star they orbit.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"398\" class=\" lazy\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304067\/original\/file-20191127-112545-8ozaan.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304067\/original\/file-20191127-112545-8ozaan.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304067\/original\/file-20191127-112545-8ozaan.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304067\/original\/file-20191127-112545-8ozaan.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=398&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304067\/original\/file-20191127-112545-8ozaan.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304067\/original\/file-20191127-112545-8ozaan.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https:\/\/images.theconversation.com\/files\/304067\/original\/file-20191127-112545-8ozaan.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=501&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\"><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fsyndication%2F2019%2F12%2F04%2Fthese-new-technologies-will-soon-answer-our-biggest-questions-about-the-universe%2F&via=thenextweb&related=thenextweb&text=Check out this picture on: An illuminated full-scale model of the James Webb Telescope.

When the light from a star reaches a planet\u2019s atmosphere, certain wavelengths are absorbed, leaving gaps in the reflected spectrum. Much like a <a href=\"https:\/\/hubblesite.org\/contents\/articles\/spectroscopy-reading-the-rainbow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">barcode<\/a>, these gaps provide a signature for the atoms and molecules of which the planet\u2019s atmosphere is made.<\/p>\n<p>The telescope will be able to read these \u201cbarcodes\u201d to detect whether a planet\u2019s atmosphere has the necessary conditions for life. In 50 years\u2019 time, we could have targets for future interstellar space missions to determine what, or who may live there.<\/p>\n<p>Closer to home, Jupiter\u2019s moon, Europa, has been identified as somewhere in our own solar system that could harbor life. Despite its cold temperature (\u2212220\u00b0C), gravitational forces from the ultra-massive planet it orbits may slosh water beneath the surface around sufficiently to prevent it from freezing, making it a possible home for microbial or even aquatic life.<\/p>\n<p>A new mission called <a href=\"https:\/\/europa.nasa.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Europa Clipper<\/a>, set for launch in 2025 will confirm whether a sub-surface ocean exists and identify a suitable landing site for a subsequent mission. It will also observe jets of liquid water fired out from the planet\u2019s icy surface to see if any organic molecules are present.<\/p>\n<p>Whether its the tiniest building blocks of our existence or the vastness of space, the universe still holds a number of mysteries about its workings and our place within it. It will not give up its secrets easily \u2013 but the chances are that the universe will look fundamentally different in 50 years\u2019 time.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

Now, it\u2019s launching a messaging function in one of the unlikeliest places \u2013 Google Photos.<\/p>\n<p>You heard it right.

But we\u2019ve heard from some of you that this could be a simpler experience, so now when you share one-off photos and videos, you\u2019ll have the option to add them to an ongoing, private conversation in the app.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While it may seem an intuitive and useful feature at first, a lot of folks use photos or links from Google photos to share it on other platforms such as Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Twitter. In those cases, it\u2019s always better for someone to get the link and download the photo to their library. Plus, if you\u2019re sharing multiple photos, creating a shared album is a superior option than sharing them in a chat window.<\/p>\n<p>Google has a habit of killing chat apps including Google Talk and YouTube Chat (yes, that existed). So we don\u2019t know if this service will last the test of time. You better use it without it gets killed.<\/p>\n<p>The feature is rolling out on\u00a0Android, iOS, and web next week.<\/p>",

He makes apps, trains neural networks, and literally has a gold badge in \u2018problem solving\u2019 on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hackerrank.com\/profile\/nick_bild\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">HackerRank<\/a>. He says he was inspired to build Tipper while sitting idle in traffic, pondering the world from an engineer\u2019s point of view.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how Tipper works, according to Bild\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/nickbild\/tipper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GitHub page<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A modified Nerf tennis ball launcher is programmatically fired with a solenoid. A 100FPS camera is pointed in the direction of the launcher and captures two successive images of the ball early in flight.<\/p>\n<p>A convolutional neural network running on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier rapidly classifies these images against a model that was built during the training phase of the project. If the images are classified as in the strike zone, a green LED on a pair of glasses (in the wearer\u2019s peripheral vision) is lit. Conversely, if the ball is predicted to be out of the strike zone, a red LED is lit.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Bild told us that he thinks Tipper could be used for good, he envisions a use-case where the AI helps batters get better:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I see the main use case as a training aid for batters, to help them recognize a good pitch as early as possible. With some tweaks, it could also be trained to watch the pitcher rather than the ball. In this way, Tipper could be used to alert pitchers if they are inadvertently tipping the batter with body language.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But he also told us he thinks there might already be something like Tipper in the wild. Something being used for <em>nefarious<\/em> purposes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s also a white elephant in the room \u2014 it could be used by a batter covertly during a game to gain an unfair advantage.<\/p>\n<p>After having built this by myself in a few weeks time, with a very small budget, I can\u2019t help but wonder if a similar device already exists and is in use. A tiny pinhole camera somewhere in the ballpark pointed at the pitcher\u2019s mound and a buzzer fully embedded in the sole of a shoe is all that would be needed.<\/p>\n<p>It would be interesting to do an analysis of batting statistics to see if there is a team where batters, on average, perform better than they have throughout their careers on other teams. Such a find would raise suspicion.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Tipper may seem innocuous enough when it\u2019s spitting Nerf balls out, but the real concern with this particular AI is the conundrum it represents.
