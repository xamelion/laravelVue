###How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

It took me 8 hours to write the code. It took some time to set up the project in Docker. If there was more time, I would form a more complex database model and add storage to VUE. Also, I would use Nuxt.js for the server render.

###How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

I do not understand the question.
